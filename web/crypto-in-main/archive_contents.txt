Package: amanda-client
Description: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, taper, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as we can write files to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

Description: Auto Nice Daemon
 The auto nice daemon activates itself in certain intervals and renices jobs
 according to their priority and CPU usage. Jobs owned by root are left alone.
 Jobs are never increased in their priority.
 .
 The renice intervals can be adjusted as well as the default nice level and
 the activation intervals. A priority database stores user/group/job tuples
 along with their renice values for three CPU usage time ranges. Negative nice
 levels are interpreted as signals to be sent to a process, triggered by CPU
 usage; this way, Netscapes going berserk can be killed automatically. The
 strategy for searching the priority database can be configured.

 AND also provides network-wide configuration files with host-specific
 sections, as well as wildcard/regexp support for commands in the priority
 database.

Source package: armagetron
Package: armagetron
Description: A 3D Tron-like high speed game.
 A 3D Tron-like high speed game.  The rules are simple: you ride a light cycle
 (a kind of motorbike that can only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall
 behind and cannot be stopped) and have to avoid running into walls while at
 the same time you have to try to get your opponent to run into them.
 .
 The idea is based on the Disney movie from 1982 called "Tron".  If you
 ever wanted to take a try at one of those speed demons features in the
 movie, this is your chance.  Of all the Tron clones out there, I think one
 is the one that comes closest to the feeling the movie tries to express.
 This is in part thanks to the sophisticated camera motions, in part to the
 superb modelling work and in part to the fabulous sound effects.  To add
 some extra fascination into the game, unlike to other Tron clones, in
 armagetron you can accelerate.  Alas, there's no accelerate button.  If
 you want to drive fast, you have to drive good -- and really really close
 to the walls.
 .
 Armagetron can be played against AI opponents, against other humans over
 the network, or a mixture of both.
 .

Source package: ash
Package: ash
Description: NetBSD /bin/sh
 "ash" is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than "bash".
 We take advantage of that by making it the shell on the installation
 root floppy, where space is at a premium.
 .
 It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
 somewhat faster than "bash"), or as the default shell either of root
 or of a second user with a userid of 0 (because it depends on fewer
 libraries, and is therefore less likely to be affected by an upgrade
 problem or a disk failure).  It is also useful for checking that a
 script uses only POSIX syntax.
 .
 "bash" is a better shell for most users, since it has some nice
 features absent from "ash", and is a required part of the system.

Source package: autoclass
Package: autoclass
Description: automatic classification or clustering
 AutoClass solves the problem of automatic discovery of classes in data

 classes in the data.  AutoClass is applicable to observations of
 things that can be described by a set of attributes, without referring
 to other things.  The data values corresponding to each attribute are
 limited to be either numbers or the elements of a fixed set of
 symbols.  With numeric data, a measurement error must be provided.  For
 more information, see

Source package: axkit
Package: axkit
Description: An XML Delivery Toolkit for Apache
 AxKit is an XML Application Server for Apache.  It provides
 on-the-fly conversion from XML to any format, such as HTML, WAP or
 text using either W3C standard techniques, or flexible custom code.
 AxKit also uses a built-in Perl interpreter to provide some amazingly
 powerful techniques for XML transformation.
 .
 The emphasis with AxKit is on separation of content from
 presentation.  The pipelining technique that AxKit uses allows
 content to be converted to a presentable format in stages, allowing
 certain platforms to see data differently to others.  AxKit allows
 web designers to focus on web site design, content developers to work
 on a purely content basis, and webmasters to focus on their core
 competencies.
 .
 AxKit is based on plugin components.  This allows the web site
 developer to create a completely custom XML Application Server based
 around the AxKit API.  AxKit can either automatically provide caching
 facilities, or you can create your own cache handler, so that XML
 transformations (which can be time consuming) only happen when
 required.
 .
 The toolkit also provides ability to build component based web sites,
 and dynamic content.  Database integration is fully supported,
 allowing either deliver of XML from a database, or XML generation
 from a database query.  Dynamic web components can be built using the
 Perl language, making the possibilities as infinite as CGI scripts,
 without the potential mess that CGI programming can cause.

 this package.



Source package: blackened
Package: blackened
Description: A feature rich ircII based IRC client
 IRC (Internet Relay Chat) provides a way of communicating in real
 time with people from all over the world. It consists of various
 separate networks (or "nets") of IRC servers, machines that allow
 users to connect to IRC. The largest nets are EFnet (the original IRC
 net, often having more than 32,000 people at once), Undernet, IRCnet,
 DALnet, NewNet and OPN.
 .
 Generally, the user (such as you) runs a program (called a "client")
 to connect to a server on one of the IRC nets. The server relays
 information to and from other servers on the same net.
 .
 The ircII program is the first widely used IRC client. IrcII has
 spawned several other clients in modern times, all of which keep the
 basic ircII command set and add to it in various more or less useful
 ways.
 .
 Blackened is an enhanced ircII based IRC client that offers a variety
 of features not found in other clients, including commands designed
 for IRC server operators and administrators.  Normal users also benefit
 from additional functionality.
 .

 Tk source files.
 .
 An attempt is being made to unify the BLT libraries so that the package is
 independent of whatever tcl/tk library (e.g. 8.0,8.2,8.3) you are using.
 This will be via the tcl stubs interface. As part of this process, blt8.0
 is obsolete and this package dynamically chooses the correct version of
 BLT library to match your situation. This makes is a lot bigger than if
 you choose the library versions yourself, but means that you always
 have the version you need (not always the case under the old system)

Source package: bock
Package: bock
Description: Bootstrap-only compiler kit for a subset of Java(tm)
 BOCK is a prototype native compiler, originally intended to enable
 a Java(tm) development environment to be bootstrapped from a C-only
 environment.  It was envisioned that its sole purpose in life would be
 to compile the forthcoming "Jackal" Java compiler.
 .
 BOCK has, since then, gained functionality, and should soon be able
 to compile most non-graphical Java programs.  Its lack of anything
 resembling error checking means that it won't be of much use for
 development, but it might be able to generate a reasonably fast binary
 version of your program.
 .
 That said, BOCK is still very much in the pre-alpha testing stage.
 It is therefore unlikely to be of use to anyone except dedicated hackers
 and developers.
 .
 Also included is "jcomp", a slightly more friendly front-end for bock,
 which compiles programs against the BOCK mini-library and compiles
 BOCK's C output to native code in one step.

Package: libboost-regex-dev
Description: Regular expression library for C++
 Part of the Boost.org library collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix

 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Source package: bzflag
Package: bzflag
Description: a 3D first person tank battle game
 BZFlag  is  a 3D multi-player tank battle game that allows
 users to play against each other in a  networked  environ-
 ment.  There are five teams:  red, green, blue, purple and
 rogue (rogue tanks are black).   Destroying  a  player  on
 another  team  scores  a  win,  while  being  destroyed or
 destroying a teammate scores a loss.  Rogues have no team-
 mates  (not even other rogues), so they cannot shoot team-
 mates and they do not have a team score.
 .
 There are two main styles of play:   capture-the-flag  and
 free-for-all.   In  capture-the-flag,  each  team  (except
 rogues) has a team base and each team with  at  least  one
 player has a team flag.  The object is to capture an enemy
 team's flag by bringing it  to  your  team's  base.   This
 destroys  every player on the captured team, subtracts one
 from that team's score, and adds one to your team's score.
 In  free-for-all,  there  are no team flags or team bases.
 The object is simply to get as high a score as possible.
 .
Package: bzflag-server
Description: bzfs - BZFlag game server and proxy
 bzfs  is  the server for BZFlag, and it must be running to

 bzrelay  is  a firewall tunnel for bzfs. It uses TCP and
 allows you and your firewalled company of friends to beat
 into submission other BZFlag players.

 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.

 The general idea behind the design of Catalog is that creating a catalog
 is mainly a matter of organizing objects in a structured tree. For
 Catalog the objects are records in a table of the SQL database.
 The structured tree is a set of tree nodes and relations between these
 nodes. The maintainer of the catalog is in charge of building the tree
 and placing objects in this tree.
 .
 Here is a short list of the functions provided by Catalog:
 .
  * Display structured trees of resources.
  * Display chronologically ordered resources and associated calendar.

  * On-Line editing of resource records.
  * Handle an arbitrary number of catalogs.
  * High performances using mod_perl and Apache.
  * Easy customization of the user view using HTML template files.
  * It is possible to define more than one view of the same catalog.
  * Load and unload a thematic catalog in XML.
  * Create an HTML dump of a structured tree to publish a static version.
  * Complete documentation including a guide and a reference manual.
  * Ready to use example.

 CatDVI can be used for previewing TeX documents on character-cell displays
 such as traditional terminals and terminal emulators.  It is also possible
 to use it in generation of plain text documents from TeX source, assuming
 that the document is written with this conversion in mind.
 .
 CatDVI is under development and as such yet incomplete.  However, it is
 quite useful even in its current form and already outperforms some of its
 competition in some areas.
 .

Source package: cdcontrol
Package: cdcontrol
Description: A parallel burner that allow you to write to one or more CD-Writter at once
 CDcontrol is a parallel CD burner program. It's allow you write
 to a unlimited number or CD writers (IDE and SCSI) at once time.
 The CDcontrol is the first burning system of that type that I know
 for *nix operating system and it's all under GPL license.
 .
 Some of it's features are better than commercial systems that I've
 hear about (and fully support CD images and all data type supported
 by cdrecord program), one of these features is the separated control
 of each recorder once the recording is started (avoid problems
 due a fail or speed problem in other writers).
 .
 The CDcontrol itself has a daily production report for each writter and
 fails of writting, in cases of more serious errors, a technical report is
 also written (it's content is a full cdrecord output for that writter, plus
 the time when it happens).
 .
 Other interesting feature is the automatic calculation of copies,
 enabling only the writers requested to complete the number and
 skipping all that are disabled.
 .
 The CDcontrol come with the following tools:
 cd-memoria - Read the CD image and write it on the permanent memory
 (HD, Raid, CDRW, etc).
 memoria-cd - Read the CD image and write it on all writers.
 apagar-cdcontrol - Delete a CD image from permanent memory
 config-cdcontrol - Allow you to manually enable/disable one or more writers.
 rel-cdcontrol - Allow you to read the success/fail reports of each day
 (the technician report is found at the subdirectory $LOG_DIR/tec and
 should be read as any text file in the system).

 Why CHICKEN?
 .
  - R5RS support.
  - SRFIs 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 22 and 23
  - Syntax-case highlevel macros
  - Lightweight threads based on first-class continuations
  - Pattern matching with Andrew Wright's match package
  - Record structures
  - A simple and straightforward module system
  - An object system with multiple inheritance, multimethods and a
    meta-object protocol
  - Separated compilation poses no problem and full tail-recursion and
    first-class continuations are suported.
  - Extended comment- and string-literal syntaxes
  - Libraries for regular expressions, string handling, Common LISP
    style format, UNIX system calls and extended data structures
  - Create interpreted or compiled shell scripts written in Scheme
  - Compiled C files can be easily distributed
  - Generates quite portable C code and compiled files generated by it
    (including itself) should work without any change on DOS, Windows,
    most UNIX-like platforms, and with minor changes on other systems.
  - Linkage to C modules and C library functions is straightforward.
    Compiled programs can easily be embedded into existing C code.
  - Simple. It can be used as a pedagogical tool for anybody who is
    interested in the workings of a compiler.
  - Extendable, since its code generation scheme, runtime system, and
    garbage collector fit neatly into a C environment.
  - Offers better performance than nearly all interpreter based
    implementations, but still provides full Scheme semantics.
  - Probably is the first implementation of Scheme that uses Henry
    Baker's [Cheney on the M.T.A] concept.
 .
 Usually, you will also need to install the chicken-dev package. The
 source files are not included since you could easily get them with
 the Debian source package. If you really feel the needs to get them
 under /usr/share/chicken/src, then please let me know.
 .
 There are many Scheme implementations available in Debian, have a look
 at each of them! Have fun!

Package: chktex
Description: Finds typographic errors in LaTeX
 * Supports over 40 warnings. Warnings include:
   + Commands terminated with space. Ignores ``\tt'', etc.
   + Space in front of references instead of ``~''.
   + Forgetting to group parenthesis characters when
     sub-/superscripting.
   + Italic correction (``\/'') mistakes (double, missing,
     unnecessary).
   + Parenthesis and environment matching.
   + Ellipsis detection; also checks whether to use ``\dots'',
     ``\cdots'' or ``\ldots''.
   + Enforcement of normal space after abbreviation. Detects most
     abbreviations automagically.
   + Enforcement of end-of-sentence space when the last sentence
     ended with capital letter.
   + Math-mode on/off detection.
   + Quote checking, both wrong types (``"'') and wrong direction.
   + Recommends splitting three quotes in a row.
   + Searching for user patterns.
   + Displays comments.
   + Space in front of ``\label'' and similar commands.
   + Use of ``x'' instead of ``$\times$'' between numbers.
   + Multiple spaces in input which will be rendered as one space
     (or multiple spaces, where that is undesirable).
   + Warns about text which may be ignored.
   + Mathematical operators typeset as variables.
   + No space in front of/after parenthesis.
   + Demands a consistent quote style.
   + Punctuation inside inner math mode/outside display math mode.
   + Use of TeX primitives where LaTeX equivalents are available.
   + Space in front of footnotes.
   + Bogus characters following commands.
 * Fully customizable. Intelligent resource format makes it possible
   to make ChkTeX respect your LaTeX setup. Even command-line options
   may be specified globally in the ``chktexrc'' file.
 * Supports ``\input'' command; both TeX and LaTeX version. Actually
   includes the files. ``TEXINPUTS''-equivalent search path.
 * Intelligent warning/error handling. The user may promote/mute
   warnings to suit his preferences. You may also mute warnings in
   the header of a file; thus killing much unwanted garbage.
 * Scripts included for checking CWEB files written in LaTeX.
   (Requires perl v5).
  * Supports both LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e.
  * Flexible output handling. Has some predefined formats and lets the
   user specify his own format. Uses a ``printf()'' similar syntax.
   ``lacheck'' compatible mode included for interfacing with the
   AUC-TeX Emacs mode.
 * ARexx scripts for interfacing with ScMsg and VBrowse are included.
   Special scripts included for CygnusED/GoldED, for binding to
   hotkey.
 * Amiga Workbench support. Parameters may be passed by
   shift-clicking the LaTeX files and setting the remaining options
   in the tooltypes.
 * Wildcard matching (Amiga only). Matches file patterns internally,
   thus saving a lot of work. This is, however, platform-specific
   code -- on UNIX boxes this is done by the shell.
 * Written in ANSI C. ``configure'' script included for easy setup
   and installation on UNIX systems.

Source package: chrony
Package: chrony
Description: It sets your computer's clock from time servers on the Net.
 It consists of a pair of programs :
 `chronyd'.  This is a daemon which runs in background on the
 system.  It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the
 system's offset relative to other systems, and adjusts the system
 time accordingly.  For isolated systems, the user can periodically
 enter the correct time by hand (using `chronyc').  In either case,
 `chronyd' determines the rate at which the computer gains or loses
 time, and compensates for this.
 `chronyc'.  This is a command-line driven control and monitoring
 program.  An administrator can use this to fine-tune various
 parameters within the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the
 daemon is running.

Source package: cint
Package: cint
Description: A C/C++ interpreter
 Cint (pronounced "C-int") is a C/C++ interpreter. It has 80-90% coverage
 of K&R-C, ANSI-C and C++ language constructs (multiple inheritance, virtual
 functions, function overloading, operator overloading, default parameters,
 templates, etc.) Cint is solid enough to interpret its own source code and
 let the interpreted interpreter interpret a (small) program. With the
 program "makecint" it is possible to mix native code execution and
 interpretation by linking to precompiled libraries.
 .
 Cint is not aimed to be a 100% ANSI/ISO compliant C++ language processor.
 It rather is a portable script language environment which is close enough
 to the standard C++.
 .
 See <http://root.cern.ch/root/Cint.html> for detailed information.



Source package: circlepack
Package: circlepack
Description: creation and display of circle packings
 CirclePack is a C program for the creation, display, manipulation, and
 storage of circle packings using the X Window System. Computations may
 be done in either hyperbolic, Euclidean, or spherical geometry, though
 the routines for the latter are not yet complete. For the theory behind
 the package, one must consult the research literature. One of the
 author's primary interests concerns the parallels between the
 developing theory of circle packings and the classical theory of
 analytic functions.

Description: Reference documentation and manpages for ClanLib
 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the
 game under any platform (supported by ClanLib, that is) without changes
 in the application sourcecode.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing an common interface
 to lowlevel libraries such as DirectX, Svgalib, X11, GGI, etc. While
 platform independency is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game sdk. In other words, we have put great effort in to
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's easy of use - while maintaining it's
 power.

Description: A lisp core that is compiled with small options.
 This is a lisp core that is loaded into memory by the
 small "lisp" C loader. It contains the compiler and the basic
 user-interface.
 .
 Having the small options means that this image will do less
 typechecking, like the fast core. Note that this doesn't
 mean it will crash at random, it just means that it only
 does the checks it _has_ to do, and that the error messages
 sometimes are not so clear.
 .
 Also to reduce the memory use it will bytecompile some
 less-often used parts. The value of this in the late 1990's
 with cheap memory is debatable.

 weapon used to shoot down ships is the photon torpedo.
 .
 The long-range goal is to conquer the universe for your
 team by taking every planet. You take planets by killing
 off the enemy's armies via bombardment, and then beaming
 your team's armies down. When all the planets have been
 taken, the game ends, a new game begins, and the player
 who actually took the last planet gets his/her name up
 in lights.



Source package: cons
Package: cons
Description: A Perl replacement for Make
 Excerpted from the README file:
 .
 Cons is a system for constructing, primarily, software, but is quite
 different from previous software construction systems. Cons was
 designed from the ground up to deal easily with the construction of
 software spread over multiple source directories. Cons makes it easy
 to create build scripts that are simple, understandable and
 maintainable. Cons ensures that complex software is easily and
 accurately reproducible.
 .
 Cons uses a number of techniques to accomplish all of this.
 Construction scripts are just Perl scripts, making them both easy to
 comprehend and very flexible. Global scoping of variables is replaced
 with an import/export mechanism for sharing information between
 scripts, significantly improving the readability and maintainability
 of each script. Construction environments are introduced: these are
 Perl objects that capture the information required for controlling the
 build process. Multiple environments are used when different semantics
 are required for generating products in the build tree. Cons
 implements automatic dependency analysis and uses this to globally
 sequence the entire build. Variant builds are easily produced from a
 single source tree. Intelligent build subsetting is possible, when
 working on localized changes. Overrides can be setup to easily
 override build instructions without modifying any scripts. MD5
 cryptographic signatures are associated with derived files, and are
 used to accurately determine whether a given file needs to be rebuilt.

 performed.  This provides a backup that is exactly the same as the
 source without filling up the drive.  As an added option, all files
 that will be overwritten or deleted when doing a copy over a previous
 backup, have the opportunity to be stored in a trash bin.  You can
 leave this trash bin to grow and grow just in case you need a backup
 of your backup.  When you start running out of disk space you will

 Kernel Core Dump patch offered by Mission Critical Linux, or kernel
 core dumps created by the LKCD patch offered by SGI.
 .
 o  The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been
    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package is configured by default to do various standard
 system maintenance tasks, such as ensuring that logfiles do not
 grow endlessly and overflow the disk.
 .
 The lockfile-progs package is only a "Suggests" because of the poor
 way that dselect handles "Recomments", but I do strongly suggest that
 you install it; it prevents /etc/cron.daily/standard from running multiple
 times if something gets jammed.

 as the standard C strftime library function).
 .
 It intended to be used in conjunction with a Web server, such as
 Apache, to split the access log into daily or monthly logs:
 .
   TransferLog "|/usr/sbin/cronolog /var/log/apache/%Y/access.%Y.%m.%d.log"
 .
 A cronosplit script is also included, to convert existing
 traditionally-rotated logs into this rotation format.

 start with. But what "of the same type" and "together" means,
 varies with the levels. If you hear someone shout that a dragon
 is always burning his elephants, so that he is not able to blow
 the volcano away, there a good chances to find Cuyo on his screen.

Source package: cvs
Package: cvs
Description: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
 of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.  Unlike the simpler systems,
 CVS does not just operate on one file at a time or one directory at
 a time, but operates on hierarchical collections of directories
 consisting of version controlled files.
 .
 CVS helps to manage releases and to control the concurrent editing of
 source files among multiple authors.  CVS allows triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations and works well over a wide area
 network.

Source package: cvs-buildpackage
Package: cvs-buildpackage
Description: Debian package scripts for CVS source trees.
 This package provides the capability to inject or import Debian
 source packages into a CVS repository, build a Debian package from
 the CVS repository, and helps in integrating upstream changes into
 the repository.
 .
 The import or inject process takes a dsc (Debian source control)
 file, and imports it into CVS. The module path can maintains
 distribution and section information; for example, one may inject
 hemm/hemm/devel/make into the repository.
 .
 The build process works analogously to dpkg-buildpackage, and can be
 used from within the checked out source tree, or with additional
 information, can be used from anywhere. In the latter case, you can
 build any previous version of the package, as long as the
 corresponding orig.tar.gz file is still around. The build script
 checks out the relevant version from the CVS repository, and runs
 dpkg-buildpackage to create the Debian package.
 .
 Combined, these utilities provide an infrastructure to facilitate the
 use of CVS by Debian maintainers. This allows one to keep separate
 CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and possibly
 experimental distributions, along with the other benefits of a
 version control system.
 .
 This can be used to generate a unified CVS source tree, for example.



Source package: cvs2cl
Package: cvs2cl

Package: cvsps
Description: Tool to generate CVS patch set information
 CVSps is a program for generating 'patch set' information from a CVS
 repository.  A patch set in this case is defined as a set of changes made
 to a collection of files, all committed at the same time (using a single
 'cvs commit' command).  This information is valuable for seeing the
 big picture of the evolution of a CVS project.  While CVS tracks revision
 information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed
 'atomically' to the repository.

Source package: cvsutils
Package: cvsutils
Description: CVS utilities for use in working directories
 Several utilities which are used to facilitate working with the
 files in the working directory of a developer using CVS.
 .
 The utilities included in this package are:
 .
 + cvsu:       Offline "cvs update" simulator. Lists the files found in
               the current directory (or in the directories which you
               specify).
 + cvsco:      "Cruel checkout". Removes results of compilation and
               discards local changes. Deletes all the files except
               listed unmodified ones and checks out everything which
               seems to be missing.
 + cvsdiscard: Discards local changes but keeps results of compilation.
               Works like "cvsco", but only deletes files which are
               likely to cause merge conflicts.
 + cvspurge:   CVS-based "make maintainer-clean". Removes results of
               compilation but keeps local changes intact. Removes
               unknown files, but keeps changes in files known to CVS.
 + cvstrim:    Removes files and directories unknown to CVS.
 + cvschroot:  Makes it possible to change CVS/Root in all subdirectories
               to the given value.
 + cvsrmadm:   Removes all CVS directories in the project. It is safer
               if you occasionally make mistakes in the "find" commands.
 + cvsdo:      Simulates some of the CVS commands (currently add, remove
               and diff) without any access to the CVS server.



Source package: cvsweb

Source package: cweb
Package: cweb
Description: Knuth's & Levy's C/C++ programming system.
 CWEB allows you to write documents which can be used simultaneously as
 C/C++ programs and as TeX documentation for them.
 .
 The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the best
 possible documentation for their programs need two things simultaneously: a
 language like TeX for formatting, and a language like C for programming.
 Neither type of language can provide the best documentation by itself.  But
 when both are appropriately combined, we obtain a system that is much more
 useful than either language separately.
 .
 You may also want to install the ctie package which allows one to
 work with multiple change files simultaneously.



Source package: cweb-latex
Package: cweb-latex
Description: LaTeX support for CWEB.
 This is the distribution of LaTeX CWEB, a bundle that allows you to
 use LaTeX as the documentation markup of your CWEB program. Your CWEB
 programs may be LaTeX documents now -- with sections, subsections,
 environments, figures, graphics inclusion, etc.
 .
 You will want to use this bundle if you
  - are a CWEB programmer and use LaTeX elsewhere,
  - haven't used CWEB up to now, because you wanted structured markup
    (and you didn't want to develop it yourself), or
  - want a hierarchic document structure for CWEB programs.
 .
 If you want to LaTeX the example program, you will need the rcs-latex
 package, although this is not essential.



Source package: cwebx
Package: cwebx
Description: C/C++ literate programming system (Marc van Leeuwen's version)
 This version is a complete rewrite of Levy & Knuth's version of CWEB.
 It uses a slightly different syntax from the L&K version, but provides a
 compatibility mode allowing L&K CWEB sources to be processed, producing
 similar (though not necessarily identical) output.
 .
 CWEB allows you to write documents which can be used simultaneously as
 C/C++ programs and as TeX documentation for them.
 .
 The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the best
 possible documentation for their programs need two things simultaneously: a

Source package: dftp
Package: dftp
Description: Alternative Debian package manager
 dftp is another program to maintain your Debian installation. It
 downloads the lists of currently available packages via FTP, compares
 them to the installed packages and lets you interactively select
 which new/upgraded packages you want to install. Dependencies of new
 packages are checked and missing packages offered for installing,
 too. Then all selected packages are fetched with FTP and verified for
 correctness. Installation of packages is done via dpkg, and ordered
 by dependencies.
 .
 dftp's main advantage over other interfaces to Debian package
 management is that it can (partially) run on a different machine than
 the target system, if that doesn't have direct FTP access. Scanning
 the current installation and installing packages must of course be
 done on the target system. But package selection and download can be
 moved to a different machine. dftp can also run on non-Debian
 systems. Therefore it is also available as a standalone version (Perl
 script) in /debian/project/misc.

Source package: diald
Package: diald
Description: dial on demand daemon for PPP and SLIP.
 Many sites use SLIP or PPP links to connect to other sites over phone
 lines. Normally these links must be explicitly turned on or off.
 diald can be used to bring a SLIP or PPP link up when there are
 Internet packets to be sent to another site, and to close the link
 down when it is idle.
 .
 diald operates by starting a virtual link on a pseudo tty and setting up
 a route to the resulting interface. This interface is called the
 proxy.  diald monitors the proxy to determine when to bring up a real
 communications link.  When a real link is up diald routes packets from
 the proxy to the real link and monitors the real link to decide if it
 needs to be shut down.  As well, if the link goes down unexpectedly
 diald will attempt to reestablish the link.  The rules for controlling
 these operations are extensively configurable in run time startup
 files.
 .
 Diald requires that you use either the ethertap interface (available
 in recent Linux kernels) or SLIP to provide the proxy interface.
 Thus, one or the other of these interfaces is required for diald to
 work.
 .
 Diald needs a program like "chat" or "expect" to actually dial.
 Sorry, "dip" cannot be used.

 your README file, run the Configure script (which is self-documented),
 and then run make.
 .
 The second component is the Makefile.SH generator, which is a generic
 configured Makefile, reusing some of the information figured out
 by Configure, and a generic Jmakefile description.
 .
 The third component is the RCS aware package generator, which is
 used when it's time to build up the shell archives used to distribute
 your program.
 .
 The fourth and latest component is the patch generator, used to
 make updates of your sources, which can later be applied on the
 original  distribution by using the patch program.  The upstream
 sources for this packlage may be downloaded from CPAN, like so:
 http://search.cpan.org/doc/RAM/dist-3.0@70

Package: dpkg-mountable
Description: Enhanced access method for dselect
 dpkg-mountable adds an access method called `mountable' to dselect's list,
 which allows you to install of any filesystem specified in /etc/fstab (eg a
 normal hard disk partition, or an NFS server), which it will automatically
 mount and umount for you if necessary.
 .
 It also has some extra features not found in the standard dselect methods,
 such as provision for a local file tree (either parallel to the main
 distribution or totally separate), and only getting packages which are
 required, rather than the time-consuming recursive directory scan, as well as
 logging of all dpkg actions in the install method.

Source package: e2fsprogs
Package: e2fsck-static
Description: A statically-linked version of the ext2 filesystem checker.
 This may be of some help to you if your filesystem gets corrupted enough
 to break the shared libraries used by the dynamically linked checker.
 .
 This binary takes much more space than its dynamic counterpart located
 in e2fsprogs, though.
 .
 You may want to install a statically-linked shell as well, to be able
 to run this program if something like your C library gets corrupted.
Package: e2fslibs-dev
Description: The headers and static libraries for ext2fs-aware tools-development.
 EXT2FS stands for "Extended Filesystem", version 2. It's the filesystem
 type used for hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and shared libraries needed to compile
 ext2fs-aware programs. Only programmers that really manipulate
 features specific to the ext2 filesystem will need this. Most
 programmers will use the generic filesystem-independent interface
 from libc.
 .
 It also contains dev files for the e2p lib used by
 the e2fsprogs, but which is not yet packaged all by itself
 because it lacks documentation. It may also lack some support
 files, by I can't really know until someone uses it...
 .
 libe2p is for user-level e2fsprogs commands.  It's used by dumpe2fs,
 chattr, and lsattr.  Functions in libe2p typically have two
 characteristics (a) don't require that block device containing the
 filesystem be opened directly (functions in libext2fs do), and (b)
 libe2p typically contains printf statements or parse user input, and so

Source package: epic
Package: epic
Description: Modified ircII client with additional functionality
 EPIC is 100% backwards compatible with ircII because EPIC *is* ircII.
 EPIC was originally built upon the ircII-2.6 client and has maintained
 faithfulness to remain current up to the 2.8.2 release.
 EPIC is somewhat larger than the stock client (24%), but that is mostly
 because of the multitude of new features, the dual ANSI/K&R compliant

Source package: equivs
Package: equivs
Description: Circumventing Debian package dependencies
 This is a dummy package which can be used to create Debian
 packages, which only contain dependency information.
 .
 This way, you can make the Debian package management
 system believe that equivalents to packages on which other
 packages do depend on are actually installed.
 .
 Another possibility is creation of a meta package. When this
 package contains a dependency as "Depends: a, b, c", then
 installing this package will also select packages a, b and c.
 Instead of "Depends", you can also use "Recommends:" or
 "Suggests:" for less demanding dependency.
 .
 Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used
 might possibly do damage to your packaging system. And please
 note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing
 with broken dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

Source package: flwm
Package: flwm
Description: Fast Light Window Manager
 Flwm is an attempt to combine the best ideas from several
 window managers. The primary influence and code base is from
 wm2 by Chris Cannam. Primary features copied from wm2 are:
 .
  - Does not look like Windoze.
  - Nifty sideways titlebars.
  - No icons. You deiconize by picking off a pop-up menu.
    This means no space is wasted by icons.
  - Really small and fast code.
 .
 It is enhanced by the author's own further nutty ideas:
 .
  - Does not use shape extension, more standard resize handles.
  - Occupies as little screen space as possible. The border and titles
    are as thin as I could possibly make them. And maximized
    windows waste only 15 pixels horizontally and zero (count'em)
    pixels vertically!
  - Independent maximize buttons for width & height, close button.
  - Understands Motif, KDE, and Gnome window manager hints.
  - Multiple desktops, controlled from the same menu as the icons.

 NOTE: The game will only run on a screen with 8 bit color depth (256 colors);
 displays with a color depth above 8 won't work. You've got to switch to
 a 8 bit display before playing the game or with XFree4.0 you could use
 an 8 bit overlay if available. The original author has abandoned the game
 so it's unlikely that the color depth problem will get fixed anytime soon. If
 you are able to fix the game for other depths please send the patch.

 fping is a ping like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol
 (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding.  fping
 differs from ping in that you can specify any number of targets on the command
 line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of
 sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a
 ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.



Source package: frad
Package: frad
Description: Frame Relay Tools for DLCI/SDLA Drivers in 2.0/2.1 kernels.
 These are frad tools that accompany the DLCI/SDLA drivers done by

 The most recent version of the firmware supplied by Sangoma is included
 in this update.
 .
 Contained is the source for 2 programs.  dlcicfg and fradcfg will read from
 a configuration file, and create the interfaces with parameters in the
 file.  Once the devices are created, the standard ifconfig can be used to
 assign IP addresses and otherwise configure the device.
 .
 These tools are an alternative to the "wanpipe" package.  The package
 might be simpler to configure since it contains only support for frame
 relay.



Source package: francine
Package: francine
Description: an extremely configurable console login program
 francine is an easy to configure themeable console login program. Its great

 makes it a greatly enhanced replacement for the old clumpy login.
 .
 You need a getty that is able to run different programs than just login. I
 suggest rungetty for that, but (alternative) getty does suffice. It can also
 be used from the telnetd with the -L option.
 .
 This project is a spin-off from the fancylogin project, which is still
 maintained by Richard Bergmair.

Source package: fsp
Package: fsp
Description: client utilities for File Service Protocol (FSP)
 FSP is an alternative to anonymous FTP.  In the words of the developers,
 `FSP is what anonymous FTP *should* be'.  FSP is a protocol, a bit like
 FTP, for moving files around.  It's designed for anonymous archives, and
 has protection against server and network overloading.  It doesn't use
 connections, so it can survive things falling over.  It's also designed to
 prevent network congestion, so it can be very nice for large transfers over
 slow links.
Package: fspd
Description: A File Service Protocol (FSP) server
 FSP is an alternative to anonymous FTP that is very resource friendly.
 The server does not fork so it can handle far more concurrent users.
 Also, the protocol is designed with a transmisson failure backoff, so
 it's transfers do not interfere with interactive network applications.
 .
 If you don't provide anonymous FTP access, you probably don't want this
 software either.

Source package: ftnchek
Package: ftnchek
Description: A semantic checker for Fortran 77 programs.
 ftnchek (short for Fortran checker) is a tool designed to detect
 certain errors in a Fortran program that a compiler usually does not,
 thus assisting users in the debugging of their Fortran programs.
 .
 Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors are legal in the Fortran
 language but are wasteful or may cause incorrect operation. For
 example, variables which are never used may indicate some omission in
 the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause
 incorrect results to be calculated; and variables which are not
 declared may not have the intended type.
 .
 ftnchek can also be used to provide call-trees, cross-reference of
 subprogram calls and COMMON blocks usage, source listings, symbol
 tables and other things you might find useful when debugging a
 Fortran program.

Description: file mirroring utility
 ftpgrab is a utility for maintaining FTP mirrors. In fact not unlike the
 "Mirror" perl program. However ftpgrab is oriented towards the smaller
 site which doesn't have the resources to mirror entire version trees of
 software.
 .
 The primary "plus point" of ftpgrab is that it can base download decisions
 by parsing version numbers out of filenames. For example, ftpgrab will
 recognize that the file "linux-2.2.2.tar.gz" is newer than
 "linux-2.2.1.tar.gz" based on the version string. It will then download
 the new version and delete the old one when it is done, thus saving you
 mirroring 10 kernel versions all at >10Mb each.

Source package: gccchecker
Package: gccchecker
Description: Memory access debugger for C language development
 Checker automatically finds:
 .
     * null pointer dereferences (read, write, and execute accesses)
     * writes to read-only memory
     * accesses to free blocks (read, write, and execute)
     * reads of uninitialized bytes (in automatic and dynamic memory)
     * reads/writes to "red zones" (in automatic and dynamic memory)
     * reads/writes/executes outside memory segments
     * free called with address not obtained from malloc
     * free an already freed block
     * ...and many other kinds of memory and API errors.
 .
 Checker's main disadvantage is that it causes the program to run much
 slower.  You can compile your program to use Checker by replacing calls
 to gcc by calls to checkergcc.  Please read the documentation in
 /usr/share/doc/gccchecker.

Source package: gemdropx
Package: gemdropx
Description: Gem Drop X is an interesting one-player puzzle game for X11
 The game is played with YOU at the bottom of the screen.  At the
 top is a random assortment of colored shapes ("gems").  As time
 goes on, more gems appear at the very top of the screen, pushing the
 rest downwards.  The game is over when the gems reach the bottom.
 .
 It's your job to keep the screen from filling up.  You do this by
 "grabbing" gems from the top of the screen, carrying them around,
 if need be, and "throwing" them back up.
 .
 If, when you throw some gems back up, you create a "match" of 3 or more
 gems in a vertical column, they disappear (with a cool little explosion).
 At this point, if there are any "matches" of the same gem to the left or
 right of this column, they disappear too!  And so on.  This is great for
 cool chain-reactions! You also get more points for the more gems that
 disappear in a match.  (Matching four gives as many points as matching
 three twice, for example.)

 calculations.  Semi-empirical methods MNDO, MINDO/3, AM1 and PM3 come
 from the MOPAC7 package (Public Domain), and are included in the
 package.
 .
 The project started as a freeware molecular modelling package, but
 since the graphical user interface part of the package is quite
 advanced and clearly written (according to our own biased view, at
 least), the package now aims to become a common framework for molecular
 modelling programs generally.

Source package: gibraltar-bootcd
Package: gibraltar-bootsupport
Description: Boot support for Gibraltar live CD-ROM
 This package contains the necessary support for the live Gibraltar CD-ROM. It
 will manage /etc and /var to be writeable and will take care of saving and
 restoring /etc.
 .
 Therefore this package should be installed on the master copy that will be
 used as the live file system on the CD-ROM. Do not install it on a system that
 boots from a harddisk partition (e.g. the development system for creating the
 bootable CD-ROMs), it will break.
Package: mkinitrd-cd
Description: Creates an initrd image suitable for booting from a live CD-ROM
 This is the package used by the Gibraltar project to create the initrd images
 used for booting from CD-ROM. The bootable CD-ROMs are actual live CD-ROMs.
 That is, the root file system is the CD-ROM, ramdisks are the only things
 needed for operation without a harddisk. Although a harddisk can be used for
 e.g. storing log files permanently or when the machine acts as a proxy
 server.
 .
 Given a kernel image and the corresponding modules, it creates a complete
 boot image that can be written to floppy or be used as El Torito image for
 a bootable CD-ROM. Upon bootup, the initrd image will try to locate an ATAPI
 CD-ROM drive. When this does not succeed, it auto-probes for SCSI adapters
 and tries to locate SCSI drives. It also works when multiple CD-ROM drives
 are installed in the system by checking if the inserted CD is the correct
 one for booting.
 .
 The package can be of use to developers and packagers who want to create
 their own bootable, live Debian CD-ROM. It will probably not be of any use
 to others.

 .
 Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin,
 and someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people
 running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with
 Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular
 operating system. Your objective is to click the mouse on them,
 ending their potential threat.  If one of the people reaches a
 computer, it will attempt to replace your operating system with the
 virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the screen with
 your vital software.  The game ends when only 0 or 1 of your
 computers is being productive.  Additionally, some computers are
 connected with network cables. When one computer on a network becomes
 infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the
 computer on the other end when it reaches there.

Source package: gnus
Package: gnus
Description: A versatile News and mailing list reader for Emacsen
 Gnus is a message-reading laboratory.  This is by far the most
 powerful and extensible news reader that I am aware of. It will let
 you look at just  about anything as if it were a newsgroup.  You can
 read mail with it,  you can browse directories with it, you can ftp
 with it---you can even read news with it! It handles single file
 groups, MH format folders, mbox files, digests, knows about POP,
 etc. It can split incoming mail ala procmail.
 .
 This version of gnus handles MIME natively. It adds offline reading
 capability with gnus-agent. It is not compatible with older versions
 of TM (since a large number of hooks and variables have changed to
 allow that). NOTE: Please do not use tm-gnus with  this version.
 .
 Instead of boring old KILL files, it has an adaptive multifaceted
 scoring mechanism -- you add or reduce the score of the article based
 on rules, and a component of the score comes in from your past
 behaviour -- for example, articles similar to ones you read and saved
 get higher scores. This adaptive mechanism is one of the most
 interesting part of Gnus.
 .
 Gnus tries to empower people who read news the same way Emacs
 empowers people who edit text.  Gnus sets no limits to what the user
 should be allowed to do.  Users are encouraged to extend Gnus to make
 it behave like they want it to behave.  A program should not control
 people; people should be empowered to do what they want by using (or
 abusing) the program.
 .
 Gnus comes by default with XEmacs, but this is a stand alone package
 that replaces the stock Gnusii. A note for people  using the nnimap
 backend: SSL support requires w3-el-e20; and even otherwise w3-el
 makes following hyperlinks in mail and news easier.  The upstream
 sources for this package are available at http://www.gnus.org/dist/gnus.tar.gz

Source package: gramofile
Package: gramofile
Description: Transfer sound from gramophone records to CD
 GramoFile enables you to record audio from (for example) gramophone
 records, process the signal and listen to the results. Because sound
 files in .WAV-format are used, it is possible to exchange the files
 with many other programs. Cdrecord(1) can burn CD-Recordables of these,
 so you can make CDs with the music of your favorite records.  The user
 interface of GramoFile has a windows-like look-and-feel, making it
 fairly easy to use.
 .
 One of the most important parts of GramoFile is the ability to process
 digital audio signals. Through the application of several filters it
 is possible to accomplish a significant reduction of disturbances like
 ticks and scratches. These filters have been programmed in such a fashion
 that they can be applied in any order (and multiple times) in a single
 run, thus avoiding the use of temporary files. It is possible to adjust
 the properties of each filter independently, so in every situation an
 optimal result can be achieved.
 .
 Another interesting feature is the track splitting. Just make one .wav
 file of an entire side of an record and GramoFile will detect where
 the individual tracks are located. This happens fully automatically,
 without need to set any options. More experienced users may fine-tune
 the algorithm, or change the detected track starts and ends, but
 generally that will not be necessary. Track-times are saved in an
 editable (plaintext) .tracks file, that will be used during the signal
 processing to produce one processed .wav file for each individual track.
 .
 To record and play .wav files, modified versions of brec(1) and bplay(1)
 by David Monro are included. These programs provide buffered recording
 and playback, so all will go well even on a highly loaded system. Both
 programs have been modified to support the standard GramoFile user
 interface.  Brec also got a `graphical' peak level meter, and bplay a
 running time display.

Source package: gri
Package: gri
Description: a language for scientific graphics programming.
 Gri is a command-driven application, as opposed to a click/point
 application.  It is analogous to latex, and shares the property that
 extensive power is the reward for tolerating a modest learning curve.
 Gri output is in industry-standard PostScript, suitable for incorporation
 in documents prepared by various text processors.
 .
 Gri can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image graphs.  In
 addition to high-level capabilities, it has enough low-level
 capabilities to allow users to achieve a high degree of customization.
 Precise control is extended to all aspects of drawing, including
 line-widths, colors, and fonts.  Text includes a subset of the tex
 language, so that it is easy to incorporate Greek letters and
 mathematical symbols in labels.
 .
 The following is a terse yet working Gri program.  If it is stored in a
 file called 'example.gri', and executed with the command 'gri example', it
 will create a postscript file called 'example.ps' with the graph.
 .
   open file.dat        # open a file
   read columns x * y   # read the 1st column as x and the 3rd as y
   draw curve           # draw the data and autoscale the axes

 Briefly stated, the GOOPS extension gives the user a full object
 oriented system with multiple inheritance and generic functions with
 multi-method dispatch.  Furthermore, the implementation relies on a
 true meta object protocol, in the spirit of the one defined for CLOS
 (Gregor Kiczales: A Metaobject Protocol).

 GOOPS. It basically consists of a shared library which can be
 dynamically linked into Guile, and a set of Scheme code libraries.
 .
 Other GOOPS packages are: libgoops5-dev, goops, goops-doc
 .
 The implementation is derived from STk-3.99.3 by Erick Gallesio and
 version 1.3 of Gregor Kiczales `Tiny-Clos'.  It is very close in
 spirit to CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System (`CLtL2') but is adapted
 for the Scheme language. While GOOPS is not compatible with any of
 these systems, GOOPS contains a compatibility module which allows for
 execution of STKlos programs.
 .
 Briefly stated, the GOOPS extension gives the user a full object
 oriented system with multiple inheritance and generic functions with
 multi-method dispatch.  Furthermore, the implementation relies on a
 true meta object protocol, in the spirit of the one defined for CLOS
 (Gregor Kiczales: A Metaobject Protocol).
Package: libgoops5-dev

Source package: hatman
Package: hatman
Description: Customizable high-resolution Pacman clone
 You have three lives, and you lose a life if you get eaten by a ghost.
 If you eat all the little dots on a level, you go onto the next level
 (if we've bothered including any). At the edge of the screen there may
 be passageways apparently going nowhere - if you follow one you will
 wrap all the way around and appear at the other side of the screen,
 yes - really, as if by magic you have been transported from one side
 of the screen to the other, and the ghosts won't know what's hit 'em.
 Also, every now and then some fruit might appear at the edge of the
 screen. Being a healthy-eating sort of guy, hatman loves fruit, so you
 should go and eat it - it's extra points, you know.
 .
 But the icing on the cake is the power-pellets. Eat one of these and
 the tables are turned. The ghosts turn gray (as one does, when one is
 scared) and now it's your turn to do some serious getting. Whilst the
 ghosts remain gray you can eat them - getting more points for each one
 you eat, once you eat them their eyes (hatman doesn't like the eyes -
 they give him indigestion) run back to the ghost's base and gets a new
 body. Don't worry about them turning back too suddenly - you will get
 a bit of a warning first.
 .
 It's easy, and it's great fun.

Source package: hercules
Package: hercules
Description: System/370, ESA/390 and z/Architecture Emulator
 Hercules is an open source software implementation of the mainframe System/370
 and ESA/390 architectures, in addition to the new 64-bit z/Architecture.
 .
 This means that your PC can emulate an IBM mainframe processor. The
 mainframe can range from a 360 to a z900 - running in "System/370"
 mode, "ESA/390" mode, or "z/Architecture" mode. Hercules executes
 S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture instructions and channel
 programs. It emulates mainframe I/O devices by using PC devices. For
 example, 3390 DASD devices are emulated by large files on your hard
 disk, and local 3270 screens are emulated by tn3270 sessions.
 .
 Hercules implements only the raw S/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture
 instruction set; it does not provide any operating system facilities. This
 means that you need to provide an operating system or standalone program which
 Hercules can load from an emulated disk or tape device. You will have to use a
 free software operating system such as Linux, write the operating system or
 standalone program yourself, obtain a license from IBM to run one of their
 operating systems on your PC, or use IBM programs and operating systems which
 have been placed in the public domain.
 .
 Virtual networking can be accomplished using the TUN/TAP driver in
 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.  For older kernels, try the vmnet package.
 .
 Hercules was created by Roger Bowler and is maintained by Jay
 Maynard. Jan Jaeger designed and implemented many of the advanced
 features of Hercules.

 on the target platform at the time.
 .
 Other services provided by Hermes include palette handling including
 caching of lookup tables, and surface clearing to a specific colour value.

  - Low-level drivers and libraries to communicate with the device. Depending on
  your hardware and operating system configuration, you may connect devices
  directly to your workstation with a parallel port or USB (Universal Serial
  Bus), or to a LAN (Local Area Network) using certain models of HP JetDirect
  print servers.
 .
  - An application programming interface (API) known as "PTAL" (Peripheral
  Transport Abstraction Library) that hides the differences in accessing
  devices connected via parallel, USB, or JetDirect.
 .
  - Printing support, largely powered by ghostscript, the HP inkjet driver
  (for selected models), and one of various print spoolers (Berkeley lpd,
  gnulpr, LPRng, CUPS, PDQ, etc.) that may already be installed on your
  computer.
 .
  - Scanning support, powered either by Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) or
  by "ptal-hp scan", a command-line application provided with the hpoj package.
 .
  - Graphical and command-line applications to access various features of the
  peripheral, such as displaying status of the device and setting the clock.

Source package: icebreaker
Package: icebreaker
Description: Break the iceberg
 So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You have
 been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where they
 are essential to a secret plot for world domination.
 .
 In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small
 chunks. (They're afraid of water, for no apparent reason. Ah well. "The
 Matrix" had more plot holes than this, and it still was a hit.) You do
 this by melting lines in the ice with Special High-Tech GNU Tools.
 .
 Once 80% or more of the iceberg is gone, the remaining chunks are small
 enough for shipping. Of course, if you manage to get rid of more than
 that, you'll save on postage, thus earning you exponential amounts of Geek
 Cred (a.k.a. "score").

 creation, image annotation, limited drawing, image distortion, etc...
 .
 This package suggests a postscript interpreter (gs) to read postscript
 files. It will however function happily without it (as long as you don't
 want to read postscript).
Package: libmagick++5
Description: The object-oriented C++ API to the ImageMagick library
 Magick++ supports an object model which is inspired by PerlMagick. Magick++
 executes faster than PerlMagick since it is accessed from a compiled
 language rather than from a scripting language. This makes it more suitable
 for Web CGI programs which must start-up and execute quickly. Images support
 implicit reference counting so that copy constructors and assignment incur
 almost no cost. The cost of actually copying an image (if necessary) is done
 just before modification and this copy is managed automatically by Magick++.
 De-referenced copies are automatically deleted. The image objects support
 value (rather than pointer)  semantics so it is trivial to support multiple
 generations of an image in memory at one time.
 .
 Magick++ provides integrated support for STL. This support allows Magick++
 to be used with the Standard Template Library (STL) so that the powerful
 containers available (e.g. deque, vector, list, and map)  can be used to
 write programs similar to those possible with PERL & PerlMagick.
 STL-compatible template versions of ImageMagick's list-style operations are
 provided so that operations may be performed on multiple images stored in
 STL containers.

Package: ipip
Description: IP over IP Encapsulation Daemon
 This daemon provides an alternative to the kernel-resident support for IP
 encapsulation links.  It is better suited for situations where there are many
 encapsulation connections to be managed, such as is the case for amateur
 radio interconnection of network 44.  Also, because the daemon is outside the
 kernel, it provides an excellent environment for experimenting with alternate
 mechanisms for distributing encapsulation routing updates.
 .
 If you need one encapsulation link, use the kernel's built-in support.  If
 you need a lot of encapsulation links, give this daemon a try.



Source package: iplogger

Source package: ipmasq
Package: ipmasq
Description: Securely initializes IP Masquerade forwarding/firewalling
 This package contains scripts to initialize IP Masquerade for use as a
 firewall.  IP Masquerade is a feature of Linux that allows an entire network
 of computers to be connected to another network (usually the Internet) with
 only one network address on the other network.  IP Masquerade is often
 referred to as NAT (Network Address Translation) on other platforms.
 .
 By default, this package configures the system as a basic forwarding
 firewall, with IP spoofing and stuffed routing protection.  The firewall
 will allow hosts behind the firewall to get to the Internet, but not allow
 connections from the Internet to reach the hosts behind the firewall.
 However, ipmasq now features a very flexible framework where you can
 override any of the predefined rules if you so choose.  It also allows you
 to control if the rules are reinterpreted when pppd brings a link up or
 down.
 .
 This package should be installed on the firewall host and not on the
 hosts behind the firewall.
 .
 IP Masquerade requires the kernel to be compiled with masquerading support
 (please see documentation for specific kernel options required).

Package: isdnlog-data
Description: data for isdnlog users
 All data related to call pricing, area codes, etc. in various countries.
Package: isdnutils
Description: Most important ISDN-related packages and utilities.
 Note that for an external ISDN adapter, you do NOT need this package or any of
 the related ones. This is only for use with an internal ISDN adapter.
 Choosing this package will select the most frequently used components.
 .
 The current version of isdnutils is split up into component packages, to make
 it easier to fine-tune what is installed; hardly anyone needs everything.
 However, it's not possible to automatically select what is needed
 This is a transitional package to ease upgrading, and choosing this selects
 the most important new packages. After upgrading, this package can be safely
 removed.
 .
 The component packages selected by this are:
  isdnutils-base   basic set of ISDN utilities.
  ipppd            for networking over ISDN with syncPPP.
  isdnlog          for logging ISDN calls (and much more).
  isdnutils-xtools for X ISDN apps (currently only xisdnload and xmonisdn)
  isdnvboxserver   ISDN answering machine, things needed on the server system.
  isdnvboxclient   ISDN answering machine, client side (vbox).
 .
 Not selected (although dselect will suggest some) are:
  isdnutils-doc    for extensive documentation (basic docs are of course
                   included with each package).
  isdneurofile     file transfer over ISDN with the special eurofile protocol.
  pppdcapiplugin   a plugin for the normal ppp daemon that uses CAPI to
                   communicate over ISDN.
  isdnactivecards  firmware for mostly active ISDN cards, and other related
                   tools.
  libcapi20        library package needed by CAPI applications (will be
                   selected automatically when needed).
Package: isdnutils-base
Description: ISDN utilities, the basic (minimal) set
 These are the basic set of ISDN utilities that you need when you have an ISDN
 card installed. For complete functionality comparable to the old isdnutils
 package, you also need the following packages:
 .
  ipppd            for networking over ISDN with syncPPP
  isdnlog          for logging ISDN calls (and much more)
  isdnutils-xtools for X ISDN apps (currently only xisdnload and xmonisdn)
  isdnutils-doc    for extensive documentation (basic docs are of course
                   included with each package).
  isdnvboxserver   ISDN answering machine, things needed on the server system
  isdnvboxclient   ISDN answering machine, client side (vbox).
Package: isdnutils-doc
Description: Extensive documentation for isdnutils
 This includes the FAQ and other miscellaneous documentation.
Package: isdnutils-xtools
Description: ISDN utilities that use X
 These are the graphical utilities for ISDN, xmonisdn and xisdnload.
 They provide, each in their own way, a visual indication of the status of
 the ISDN lines, so that it is directly obvious when there is a connection,
 for example.
 .
 This has been separated out of the main isdnutils package so that if you
 don't run X but do need ISDN, you don't have to include the X libraries
 unnecessarily.
Package: isdnvbox

 the software (isdnvboxserver); that system may be elsewhere, as long as
 it can be connected to via a network.
Package: isdnvboxserver
Description: ISDN answering machine, server
 Let your debian system be your answering machine! Messages can be accessed
 remotely, automatically emailed, etc.
 .
 This is the server part of the software. This is what needs to be installed
 on the system with the ISDN card. To actually listen to the recorded messages
 you need the client package (isdnvboxclient) somewhere, not necessarily on
 the same system.
Package: libcapi20
Description: libraries for CAPI support
 If you have an ISDN card with which CAPI works, you may be able to use
 applications that use CAPI, e.g. a fax system. At this point, AVM cards can
 work with CAPI, as well as some active cards. For the AVM passive cards you
 need to visit the www.AVM.de website.
 .
 If you need this package, it will be installed automatically via dependencies,
 no need to select it yourself.
Package: pppdcapiplugin
Description: plugin for pppd to communicate with CAPI-capable ISDN cards
 Some ISDN cards (notably the AVM passive cards, when a module from the AVM
 website is loaded) can be used by CAPI utilities.
 This is a plugin for the regular PPP daemon to use CAPI on such cards.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/pppdcapiplugin/* for some (rudimentary) info.

 ispell-dictionary package and a wordlist package.
 (You must have an ispell dictionary before you can
 use ispell; a wordlist is only required for ispell's
 (L)ookup command.)
 .
 This ispell package supports either the "new-style"
 idict-<language> dictionaries or the "old-style"
 i<language> dictionaries.  As of February 2001,
 only old-style dictionaries are available, because
 the dictionaries-common standards and package have
 not been finalized.  When dictionaries-common and
 the idict-<language> dictionaries become available,
 this version of ispell will be able to use them.

Source package: jack
Package: jack
Description: Rip and encode CDs with one command
 Jack has been developed with one main goal: making MP3s or OGGs
 without having to worry. There is nearly no way that an incomplete rip
 goes unnoticed, e.g. jack compares WAV and MP3 file sizes when
 continuing from a previous run. Jack also checks your HD space before
 doing anything (even keeps some MB free).
 .
 Jack is different from other such tools in a number of ways:
  - it supports different rippers and encoders
  - it is very configurable
  - it doesn't need X
  - it can "rip" virtual CD images like the ones created by cdrdao
  - when using cdparanoia, cdparanoia's status information is displayed
    for all tracks, so you can see if something went wrong
  - it uses sophisticated disk space management, i.e. it schedules it's
    ripping/encoding processes depending on available space.
  - freedb query, file renaming and id3 tagging
  - it can resume work after it has been interrupted. If all tracks have
    been ripped, it doesn't even need the CD anymore, even if you want
    to do a freedb query.
  - it can do a freedb query based on MP3s alone, like if you don't
    remember from which CD those MP3s came from.
  - freedb submissions

   * able to rewrite GET and optionally ICP_QUERY requests as well
   * one global configuration file
   * one IP access control file which supports CIDR notation only
     (i.e. subnet/mask). Thus only URL requests from the specified
   * subnets/clients are rewritten, if necessary.
   * one rewrite rules configuration file (regular expression matching
     and replacement)

       6.change the redirect rules
   * If you mess up configuration file[s], Jesred runs in Echo Mode
     (always echos back a newline - i.e. no URL replacement) and squid
     keeps working.

Source package: jiffy
Package: jiffy
Description: Visualization for nec-based antenna designs
 It is never been easier to design antennas!  Most hams enjoy
 ``fiddling'' with antennas, but comparatively few of us are really
 interested in doing one-handed chin-ups at fifty feet above the cold
 frozen earth on a snowy and windy night in January.
 .
 Jiffy will make life a lot easier for you. It can make a drawing
 from the antenna design that you made and it can display elevation
 and azimuth patterns from the nec output.

Source package: jigdo
Package: jigdo-file
Description: Download Debian CD images from any Debian mirror
 Using the jigdo-lite script contained in this package, you can use
 your nearest "regular" Debian mirror to download Debian CD images,
 instead of having to use one of the few, slow, overloaded mirrors
 that offer the images as direct HTTP or FTP downloads. See
 <http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/> for details.
 .
 Jigsaw Download, or short jigdo, is a scheme developed primarily to
 make it easy to distribute huge filesystem images (e.g. CD (ISO9660)
 or DVD (UDF) images) over the internet, but it could also be used for
 other data which is awkward to handle due to its size, like
 audio/video files or large software packages.
 .
 jigdo tries to ensure that the large file is downloaded in small
 parts which can be stored on different servers. People who want to
 download the image do so by telling the jigdo download tool to
 process one ".jigdo" file; using it, jigdo downloads the parts and
 reassembles the image. jigdo-file is used to prepare the files for
 download.



Source package: jikes
Package: jikes
Description: Fast Java compiler adhering to language and VM specifications
 Jikes is a Java compiler that translates Java source files as defined in The
 Java Language Specification (Addison-Wesley, 1996) into the bytecoded
 instruction set and binary format defined in The Java Virtual Machine
 Specification (Addison-Wesley, 1996). Unlike other compilers, Jikes accepts
 the Java language only as specified: not as a subset, variant, or superset.
 .
 In addition to strictly adhering to specifications, Jikes is faster than most
 compilers and can compute the complete dependency relations in program files.
 This allows for the generation of dependency makefiles suitable for use with
 make. Jikes can also be run in incremental mode: after the initial
 compilation, Jikes waits until prompted, determines which files have been
 changed, and then does the minimal amount of work needed to bring the class
 files into a complete and consistent state. This cycle can be repeated until
 the q command is entered to end the compilation.



Source package: jikespg
Package: jikespg
Description: Jikes Parser Generator
 Jikes Parser Generator is a parser generator that accepts as input an
 annotated  description for a language grammar and produces text files

 function and use to the widely-available parser generators Yacc and Bison.
 .
 It also provides support for automatic diagnosis and recovery from syntactic
 errors. It is the parser generator used by the Jikes Compiler. Jikes Parser
 Generator can generate parsers for LALR(k) grammars and produce output
 suitable for use with parsers written in Java, C, or C++.

Package: jless
Description: A file pager program, similar to more(1) supporting ISO2022
 Jless is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward
 movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, jless does not
 have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
 files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1).  Jless uses
 terminfo, so it can run on a variety of terminals.  There is even limited
 support for hardcopy terminals.
 .
 Jless supporting ISO 2022 code extension techniques and Japanese codes.

Source package: joe
Package: joe
Description: user friendly full screen text editor
 Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has six help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 Joe has a great screen update optimization algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection
 menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, and block move, copy, delete or filter.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete immitation
 of WordStar, and a restricted mode version (lets you edit only the files
 specified on the command line).  Joe also has a deferred screen update to
 handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not bypassed by tty
 buffering.  It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work on any
 kind of sane terminal.

Package: jslaunch
Description: Joystick button shell command execution/shutdown tool
 jslaunch is a very small daemon/program that will start a specified
 shell command when a combination of joystick buttons is pressed.
 One of its uses is as a backup way to make a clean shutdown
 if your console has been messed up by X11 or SVGAlib and you
 don't have a terminal sitting on your desk to log in and
 shut down from, but you can use it for example as a remote
 control to do just about anything (including starting a measurement
 on an experimental setup connected to your computer).
 You will not need any joystick drivers.



Source package: jtex-base
Package: jtex-base
Description: basic jTeX library files.
 jTeX is a TeX for Japanese language.



Source package: juice
Package: juice
Description: playlist editor / player frontend
 Juice is a frontend for mpg123 and other players. It provides
 a nifty dialog-based playlist editor.
 .
 It basically allows you to browse through your files in a
 "Midnight Commander"-like fashion. The MP3's you select are
 treated as a playlist which can be shuffled, rearranged,
 saved, etc.
 .
 In order to play audio files, two player interfaces are
 provided. The mpg123-specific interface uses the remote
 protocol of mpg123 (This feature was introduced in version
 0.59r in order to accommodate generic frontends.) The other
 player frontend is generic and allows for any player to be
 used. This is useful if you do not want to limit the
 functionality of juice to MP3's. Please note that this
 generic frontend is still in early beta phase and is
 pretty buggy.
 .
 Of course juice comes with all the bells & whistles you'd
 expect from a quality application and has (among others)
 full integrated help functionality as well as full dialog
 based configuration file editor.

Source package: junior-arcade
Package: junior-arcade
Description: Debian Jr. arcade games
 This meta package will install arcade games suitable, in the
 opinion of the contributors to the Debian Jr. project, for children
 of all ages.  Mastering most of these games requires dexterity
 and cognitive skills usually developed only in the older children
 (around ages 5 to 8).  But the youngest children may enjoy watching
 older players, or just poking randomly at the controls, depending
 on the game.



Source package: junior-art
Package: junior-art
Description: Debian Jr. Art
 Tools for children to produce artwork.  While gimp is more complex,
 and is aimed at the graphic artist, it is not necessarily much harder
 to use than the older, less full-featured xpaint.  Children starting
 out with just a small subset of the functions of these tools
 eventually pick up quite a number of new things as they explore,
 either with adults or other children with whom they share their
 computers, or on their own.



Source package: junior-doc
Package: junior-doc
Description: Debian Jr. Documentation
 Includes, for the moment, just the "Quick Guide" which helps a new user
 of Debian Jr. get started.  The intention of the Debian Jr. working
 group is to provide a variety of additional documents to help children
 and sys admins alike with the installation, configuration, and use of a
 Debian Jr. system.



Source package: junior-games-card
Package: junior-games-card
Description: Debian Jr. Card Games
 A collection of card games, for the time being just solitaire, which
 are probably more suited to older children than young, although
 the "memory" type games in pysol may appeal to children just entering
 grade school.



Source package: junior-games-gl
Package: junior-games-gl
Description: Debian Jr. 3D Games (hardware acceleration required)
 These games all use OpenGL libraries.  They will not work without
 decent 3D graphics cards providing hardware-accelerated OpenGL.
 .
 While armagetron and gltron are different interpretations of the
 game depicted in the classic 3D-animated movie "Tron", Tux Racer
 is an all-original made-for-Linux 3D racing game.  Unlike the
 standard blood-and-guts fare in the 3D games universe, all of
 these games are suitable for children.



Source package: junior-games-net
Package: junior-games-net
Description: Debian Jr. Network Games
 While XPilot has a broad international community of players (mostly
 on high-bandwidth connections) it can be enjoyed on a home network
 as well.  XBlast, on the other hand, achieves networking using the X
 protocol, so it is best suited to a local network.



Source package: junior-games-sim
Package: junior-games-sim
Description: Debian Jr. Simulation Games
 Simulation games tend to be rather complex, so we recommend them for
 older children, and even then some help from someone older may be
 needed.



Source package: junior-games-text
Package: junior-games-text
Description: Debian Jr. Text Games
 The principal virtue of these games is their simplicity.  They will run
 on any hardware, and some of them are simple enough to control so that
 very young children can enjoy them (e.g. snake)



Source package: junior-gnome
Package: junior-gnome
Description: Debian Jr. for Gnome
 This package includes a collection of programs for children
 which are built for Gnome.  A Gnome desktop is not required
 in order to run these.  They are kept separate merely so that
 installing a Debian Jr. system won't drag in all kinds of
 Gnome dependencies.
 .
 As such, this package is by no means a complete collection of
 programs suitable for children in Gnome.  The Debian Jr. project
 will be adding to this list in future release, and likely
 refining the package into categories the way the rest of Debian
 Jr. packages are now organized.



Source package: junior-kde
Package: junior-kde
Description: Debian Jr. for KDE
 This package includes a collection of programs for children
 which are built for KDE.  A KDE desktop is not required
 in order to run these.  They are kept separate merely so that
 installing a Debian Jr. system won't drag in all kinds of
 KDE dependencies.
 .
 As such, this package is by no means a complete collection of
 programs suitable for children in KDE.  The Debian Jr. project
 will be adding to this list in future releases, and likely
 refining the package into categories the way the rest of Debian
 Jr. packages are now organized.



Source package: junior-math
Package: junior-math
Description: Debian Jr. educational math
 This meta package will install educational math programs suitable for
 children.  Some of the packages use mathematics that is well beyond
 the abilities of young children (e.g. fractals and cryptography), but
 we hope that by using them they gain an appreciation of the beauty of
 math from an early age.  Other packages allow children to explore and
 learn math concepts in an engaging, interactive way.  Some packages
 are more general, providing math activities as only one part of the
 package, e.g. bsdgames includes "arithmetic" in addition to other
 non-math games, and xbase-clients provides xcalc.



Source package: junior-programming
Package: junior-programming
Description: Debian Jr. programming
 The emphasis for this sampling of programming packages for children
 is first on simple interpreted languages.  Also important for using
 languages with children are good documentation, and some ability to
 produce visual programs without too much effort.  It is by no means
 a complete list, and your are encouraged to explore other languages
 with children as well.
 .
 The Logo language is specifically designed for children, with a strong
 emphasis on the visual and concrete, while Python is recognized as
 a good language to teach programming with, has very good docs, and
 a number of different gui bindings, Tk being the most common so that
 is what is included here.



Source package: junior-puzzle
Package: junior-puzzle
Description: Debian Jr. Puzzles
 Some puzzle-type games, from the more arcade-like rocks-n-diamonds
 to xjig (a jigsaw puzzle program), to lmemory (based on the classic
 "memory" card game), we hope this sampling of packages will appeal
 to child and adult alike.



Source package: junior-sound
Package: junior-sound
Description: Debian Jr. sound
 This meta package will install a sampling of sound packages for
 a system that is used by children.  While not all of these will
 be things that children will use directly, a child's system
 administrator can make use of them to ensure that the child
 gets the most out of their system.



Source package: junior-system
Package: junior-system
Description: Debian Jr. System tools
 This package includes a few tools for helping children learn about and
 use their system.
 .
 Midnight Commander is more than just a file manager.  It is shell with
 which children can explore and manage their own accounts.  It can be a
 great help for the very young, as it saves them some typing (as
 compared with using a command-line shell directly).  It is also packed
 with power and flexibility which can be tapped by older children and
 adults alike.
 .
 The 'hello' sample program can be used as an instructional aid, as
 an example of how to invoke programs from the shell, specify switches,
 use the man page, and so on.
 .
 A fun way to visualize filesystems is by using xcruise to zoom about
 from node to node through "galaxies" of files, directories, and
 symbolic links.
 .
 Finally, lavaps not only provides a very pleasing way to visualize
 running processes and the resources they use, but can also make
 discovering and killing errant processes an easy thing to do for
 children who lack the ability yet to easily manage "ps" and "kill"
 from the command line.



Source package: junior-toys

 This meta package will install tools for your budding young
 writers.  Since there are a wide variety of opinions as to
 what constitutes the "best" text editor, a number are provided
 to choose from.  A spell-checker and dictionary client are
 provided as well.  Finally, abiword is included as our choice
 for a word processor.

Description: A junk-email filtering program for procmail
 This package uses procmail filtering algorithms to detect junk email. This
 results in internal procmail variables being assigned to indicate the reason
 why the email has been classified as junk. The user can then use those
 variables within their .procmailrc file to deal with the junk in any way
 they see fit. There are a number of filters available in the package, and
 can be selected from a simple config file on a per-user basis.

Source package: kascade
Package: kascade
Description: Client for Kascade, a distributed Open directory search-engine
 Kascade is a novel type of search-engine, based on the Open directory
 principle. This means that anyone can structure a small part of the
 information on the internet, corresponding to their personal interests or
 expertise. The resulting parts are placed in a large categorical structure
 that others can browse to search for information. Examples of Open Directory
 initiatives are Dmoz and Infomarker.
 .
 In contrast with other Open Directory initiatives, though, the parts that
 people maintain now reside on their own server. What results is a distributed
 Open Directory! As with Gnutella, though, there are no fixed central servers.
 This implies that anyone can start a new structure. Actually any piece can
 be easily replaced, hopefully leading to competitive improvement. The
 distributed nature and lack of central control facilities make for a
 system immune to company or government control, much like Gnutella and the
 Internet itself.

 A ball begins to bounce off of an area enclosed by four borders
 (like a square). You must move your pointer to certain areas
 within the square. Upon clicking, a new border is constructed at
 a relatively quick pace. You can change the direction of the borders by 90
 degrees as well. Ultimately, you must force the ball to bounce around in a
 smaller, and smaller area as time goes by without the ball ever
 touching the borders as they are being constructed. If a ball touches a
 certain part of the border as it is being built, the game is over.
 After 75% of the original space has been blocked off from the moving
 ball, you advance one level, and one more ball is added to the
 mix in the following level.

 not careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong places and/or block
 your way.

 even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves and/or pushes you
 use to solve the level.
 .

 collections with easier levels are also included in KSokoban. These are
 marked (easy) in the level collection menu. Of course, these levels can be
 fun for adults too, for example if you don't want to expose yourself to too

 until it reaches the ground level or another stone. After a move is
 done it is the turn of the other player. This is repeated until the
 game is over, i.e. one of the players has four pieces in a row, column
 or diagonal or no more moves are possible because the board is filled.

 removed that are not needed when used in conjunction with Unix desktop
 environments. This includes image I/O and non-Unix platform support. This was
 done in order to make the library as small as possible for inclusion in KDE,
 which is required since most distributions don't include recent devel versions
 of ImageMagick and if they do they include it only as a static library which is
 not optimal.

Source package: kernel-package
Package: kernel-package
Description: Debian Linux kernel package build scripts.
 This package provides the capability to create a debian kernel-image
 package by just running make-kpkg kernel_image in a kernel source
 directory tree.  It can also package the relevant kernel headers into
 a kernel-headers package. In general, this package is very useful if
 you need to create a custom kernel, if, for example, the default
 kernel does not support some of your hardware, or you wish a leaner,
 meaner kernel.  It also scripts the steps that need be taken to
 compile the kernel, which is quite convenient (forgetting a crucial
 step once was the initial motivation for this package). Please look at
 /usr/share/doc/kernel-package/Rationale.gz for a full list of advantages
 of this package.
 .
 If you are running on an intel x86 platform, and you wish to compile a
 custom kernel (why else are you considering this package?), then you may
 need the package bin86 as well.  (This is not required on other platforms).

 This update is needed if you get a lot of scsi-errors, and if you notice
 that recoverable failures are fatal.
 The errors to look for are these:
 (scsi0:0:0:1) CHECK_CONDITION on REQUEST_SENSE, returning an error.
 scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
 SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
 and fatal:
 SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 1 lun 0 return code = 26030000

Source package: kernel-patch-2.2.20-raid
Package: kernel-patch-2.2.20-raid
Description: Ingo Molnar's patch of raid2 functionality to 2.2.x
 This patch enables the "new" raid functionality, standard in 2.4.x kernels,
 to be used with 2.2.x kernels.  When running a kernel with this patch,
 one should install the raidtools2 Debian package, which will also facilitate
 upgrades of older raid arrays to the new structure.  New features include
 optional kernel autodetection of raid arrays at boot time, recognition of
 raid arrays when disk device names have changed, and "hot" adding and
 removal of devices to running raid arrays.  A small patch has been added
 to run the autodetect procedure when raid modules are loaded, thereby
 enabling initrd scripts to probe for and analyze filesystems on raid
 devices when looking for a "real" root filesystem.

Description: High Availability Clustering Package
 Kimberlite is a complete framework providing high availability for application
 services on Linux.  The key features of the architecture include the
 following:
 .
  - A complete high-availability service infrastructure prevents you
    from having to assemble an infrastructure from disparate
    components.
 .
  - An extensible service-configuration framework enables you to
    easily integrate a wide variety of applications.
 .
  - An exceptional data integrity guarantee differentiates the
    software from other contemporary offerings from the Linux
    community.  Because of this guarantee, a Kimberlite cluster
    provides a solid foundation for highly-available data services,
    such as network-exported databases and NFS file systems, and is
    ideal as the data tier for dynamic web content.
 .
  - Services fail over automatically when problems occur, without
    requiring manual intervention by system administrators.
 .
  - A command line user interface and a web-based graphical user
    interface enable you to monitor and manage the cluster.
 .
  - A cluster utilizes commodity hardware and storage options, such as
    SCSI and FibreChannel.

 is that yacc and lex are used to do the parsing, and
 Kimwitu routines are used to built and manipulate the
 parse tree.
 .
 There is also Kimwitu++ (also packaged for Debian) which interfaces
 with C++ instead of C.



Source package: kimwitu++
Package: kimwitu++
Description: A (syntax-)tree-handling tool (term processor)
 Kimwitu++ is a system that supports the construction of programs that use
 trees or terms as their main data structure.  It allows you to define, store
 and operate on trees with typed nodes. Each type of node has a specific number
 of sons, and expects these sons to have specific types.  The most popular
 example of such trees are syntax trees.
 .
 The nodes are defined in a Yacc-like fashion.  The tree can be unparsed (ie.
 treewalk) and rewritten (ie. term substitution). Kimwitu++ gives you powerful
 pattern matching for specifying unparse and rewrite rules.
 .
 Kimwitu++ is an extension to C++. It introduces Yacc-like node definitions,
 the unparse and rewrite rules, and extensions for pattern matching within
 functions. It will translate its input files into pure C++.
 .
 To build the tree you might use a parser generated with Bison, but you are
 free to use other tools.  There also exists Kimwitu (also packaged for Debian)
 which interfaces with C instead of C++ which can also be used in C++ projects,
 but Kimwitu++ has some extensions one might consider useful.

Source package: latex2html
Package: latex2html
Description: LaTeX to HTML translator.
 LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts documents written
 in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration
 path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar
 word-processing concepts.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document.
 .
 Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the
 LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format. Because of certain
 legal limitations on the use of the GIF image format, GIF support is
 disabled in this package.

Source package: lclint
Package: lclint
Description: A tool for statically checking C programs.
 LCLint is a tool for statically checking C programs.  With minimal
 effort, LCLint can be used as a better lint.  If additional effort is
 invested adding annotations to programs, LCLint can perform stronger
 checks than can be done by any standard lint.
 .
 LCLint does many of the traditional lint checks including unused
 declarations, type inconsistencies, use-before-definition, unreachable
 code, ignored return values, execution paths with no return, likely
 infinite loops, and fall-through cases.  Our main focus, however, is on
 more powerful checks that are made possible by additional information
 given in source code annotations.  Annotations are stylized comments
 that document certain assumptions about functions, variables,
 parameters, and types.  They may be used to indicate where the
 representation of a user-defined type is hidden, to limit where a global
 variable may be used or modified, to constrain what a function
 implementation may do to its parameters, and to express checked
 assumptions about variables, types, structure fields, function
 parameters, and function results.  In addition to the checks
 specifically enabled by annotations, many of the traditional lint checks
 are improved by exploiting this additional information.

Source package: libapache-mod-cgi-debug
Package: libapache-mod-cgi-debug
Description: Easier debugging of CGI scripts
 This module is designed to help with the CGI programming and debugging process.
 While programming a CGI script, it is often rather difficult to discover what
 is actually getting returned to the web server. Rather than chopping up your
 CGI script with a whole bunch of debug print statements, a single change to
 the action statement of the calling form will bring up a nicely formatted
 page with all of the information that the web server sees, including any get
 and post arguments, and the send and receive headers.
 .
 Warning: the author doesn't recommend using this module on a production
 server.



Source package: libapache-mod-dav
Package: libapache-mod-dav
Description: A DAV module for Apache
 mod_dav is an Apache module to provide DAV capabilities for the
 Apache web server.
 .
 DAV stands for Distributed Authoring and Versioning. Sometimes, it is
 referred to as WebDAV. In any case, it is about using HTTP to provide
 enhanced capabilities to a server. A typical scenario is authoring
 pages on a website. No more proprietary Fusion, FrontPage, or other
 extensions, but a standardized way to work with a (web)
 server. However, DAV is capable of much more than simple authoring --
 a quick review of the mailing lists shows that it is being envisioned
 for document management systems, complex configuration management
 systems (aka version control, source control; e.g. CVS), and all
 other kinds of nifty web-based data repositories. A rude paraphrase
 of its capabilities would be to say that it is a web-based
 filesystem, augmented with properties on the directories and files.

 It changes the remote address of the client visible to other Apache modules
 when two conditions are satisfied. First condition is that the remote client
 is actually a proxy that is defined in httpd.conf. Secondly if there is an
 incoming X-Forwarded-For header and the proxy is in it's list of known
 proxies it takes the last IP from the incoming X-Forwarded-For header and
 changes the remote address of the client in the request structure.



Source package: libapache-mod-ruby

 Schwartz's Stonehenge::Reload module that attempts to be a little
 more intuitive and makes the usage easier.  Stonehenge::Reload was
 written by Randal to make specific modules reload themselves when
 they changed. Unlike Apache::StatINC, Stonehenge::Reload only checked
 the change time of modules that registered themselves with
 Stonehenge::Reload, thus reducing stat() calls. Apache::Reload also
 offers the exact same functionality as Apache::StatINC, and is thus
 designed to be a drop-in replacement. Apache::Reload only checks
 modules that register themselves with Apache::Reload if you
 explicitly turn off the StatINC emulation method (see below). Like
 Apache::StatINC, Apache::Reload must be installed as an Init Handler.

 A staging place is a place where an author of an HTML document checks
 the look and feel of a document before it's uploaded to the final
 location. A staging place doesn't need to be a separate server, nor
 need it be a mirror of the "real" tree, and not even a tree of
 symbolic links. A sparse directory tree that holds nothing but the
 staged files will do.

 could be made generic (things like the theme parsing engine, the
 command-line options parser, perhaps the event engine, ...) and place
 it here in the hopes that others will find them useful.

 used scripts, which can then be executed locally or remotely (via
 Net::Telnet), by just entering a password (for remote scripts), and
 clicking.



Source package: libcgi-perl
Package: libcgi-perl
Description: modules for perl5, for use in writing CGI scripts.
 In addition to this package, you will also need the URI::Unescape
 class, which is part of the libwww-perl package. This is the
 replacement for the now obsolete CGI-modules package.
 .
 This package is destined to replace libcgi-pm-perl, but at the moment
 libcgi-pm-perl (as in the library CGI.pm) serves as the rapid
 prototyping version, and may be more featureful than this package.
 Indeed, there has been a hiatus of several years in the development of
 this module.
 .
 This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the
 fly and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for
 parsing and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts.
 However, it also offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out
 forms. Instead of remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you
 just make a series of perl function calls. An important fringe benefit
 of this is that the value of the previous query is used to initialize
 the form, so that the state of the form is preserved from invocation
 to invocation. This package was downloaded from the site:
 http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/CGIperl/

Source package: libcgi-ssi-perl
Package: libcgi-ssi-perl
Description: perl CGI::SSI - Use SSI from CGI scripts
 CGI::SSI is meant to be used as an easy way to filter shtml through CGI
 scripts in a loose imitation of Apache's mod_include. If you're using
 Apache, you may want to use either mod_include or the Apache::SSI module
 instead of CGI::SSI. Limitations in a CGI script's knowledge of how the
 server behaves make some SSI directives impossible to imitate from a CGI
 script.

 objects. Typical applications that need this kind of ability include graphical
 user interfaces, image processing libraries, mixed-precision numerical
 computation systems, and most types of simulations.

Source package: libdate-calc-perl
Package: libdate-calc-perl
Description: Perl library for accessing dates
 The package provides a Perl interface to a C library which offers a
 wide variety of date calculations based on the Gregorian calendar
 (the one used in all western countries today), complying with the
 ISO/R 2015-1971 and DIN 1355 standards which specify things as what

 the main focus of Date::Manip has been to be able to do ANY desired
 date/time operation easily, not necessarily quickly.  There are other
 modules that can do a small subset of the operations available in
 Date::Manip much quicker than those presented here, so if speed is a
 primary issue, you should look elsewhere.

 central file.



Source package: libdbix-profile-perl
Package: libdbix-profile-perl
Description: DBI query profiler
 DBIx::Profile is a quick and easy, and mostly transparent, profiler
 for scripts using DBI.  It collects information on the query
 level, and keeps track of first, failed, normal, and total amounts
 (count, wall clock, CPU time) for each function on the query.
 .
 NOTE: DBIx::Profile use Time::HiRes to clock the wall time and
 the old standby times() to clock the CPU time.  The CPU time is
 pretty coarse.
 .
 DBIx::Profile can also trace the execution of queries.  It will print
 a timestamp and the query that was called.  This is optional, and
 occurs only when the environment variable DBIXPROFILETRACE is set
 to 1. (ex: (bash) export DBIXPROFILETRACE=1).



Source package: libdbix-recordset-perl
Package: libdbix-recordset-perl
Description: Perl extension for DBI recordsets
 DBIx::Recordset is a perl module for abstraction and simplification of
 database access.
 .
 The goal is to make standard database access (select/insert/update/delete)
 easier to handle and independent of the underlying DBMS. Special attention is
 made on web applications to make it possible to handle the state-less access
 and to process the posted data of form fields, but DBIx::Recordset is not
 limited to web applications.
 .
 DBIx::Recordset uses the DBI API to access the database, so it should
 work with every database for which a DBD driver is available (see
 also DBIx::Compat).
 .
 Most public functions take a hash reference as parameter, which makes
 it simple to supply various different arguments to the same
 function. The parameter hash can also be taken from a hash containing
 posted form fields like those available with CGI.pm, mod_perl,
 HTML::Embperl and others.

Source package: libexpect-perl
Package: libexpect-perl
Description: Expect.pm - Perl Expect interface
 The Expect module is a successor of Comm.pl and a descendent of Chat.pl. It
 more closely ressembles the Tcl Expect language than its predecessors. It

 decision processing more fluid. three separate types of debugging have
 been implemented to make code production easier.
 .
 It is now possible to interconnect multiple file handles (and processes) much
 like Tcl's expect. An attempt was made to enable all the features of Tcl's
 expect without forcing Tcl on the victim programmer :-) .

 This is a perl module to allow accessing weather info.



Source package: libgetargs-long-perl
Package: libgetargs-long-perl
Description: Perl module to parse long function arguments
 The Getargs::Long module allows usage of named parameters in function
 calls, along with optional argument type-checking.  It provides an easy
 way to get at the parameters within the routine, and yields concise
 descriptions for the common cases of all-mandatory and all-optional
 parameter lists.
 .
 The validation of arguments can be done by a structure-driven routine
 getargs() which is fine for infrequently called routines (but should be
 slower), or via a dedicated routine created and compiled on the fly the
 first time it is needed, by using the cgetargs() family (expected to be
 faster).
 .
 The Log::Agent module is used to report errors, which leaves to the
 application the choice of the final logging method: to a file, to
 STDERR, or to syslog.
 .
 Note that this module is still in the alpha stage of development, and
 the interface to it may change: indeed, it changed between 0.1.2 and
 0.1.3.



Source package: libgetopt-argfile-perl
Package: libgetopt-argfile-perl
Description: Perl module for reading script options and parameters from files
 This module simply interpolates option file hints in @ARGV by the
 contents of the pointed files.  This enables option reading from
 files instead of or additional to the usual reading from the command
 line.
 .
 Alternatively, you can process any array instead of @ARGV which is
 used by default and mentioned mostly in this manual.
 .
 The interpolated @ARGV could be subsequently processed by the usual
 option handling, e.g. by a Getopt::xxx module.  Getopt::ArgvFile does
 not perform any option handling itself, it only prepares the array
 @ARGV.



Source package: libgetopt-declare-perl
Package: libgetopt-declare-perl
Description: Getopt::Declare command line argument parser
 Getopt::Declare provides facilities to parse command line options.  It
 builds and runs a parser.  The parser object can be saved and later run on
 different input.  Key features are:
 .
 - Automatic generation of error, usage and version information
 - Matching of parameter components may be constrained by regular expressions
 - Execution of embedded actions
 - Declarative specification of inter-parameter relationships
 - Selective or global case-insensitive matching of parameters



Source package: libgetopt-mixed-perl
Package: libgetopt-mixed-perl
Description: Perl module for processing options in GNU-style (= long and short)
 This module is intended to be the "Getopt-to-end-all-Getop's".  It
 combines flexibility and simplicity.  It supports both short options
 (introduced by `-') and long options (introduced by `--').  Short
 options which do not take an argument can be grouped together.  Short
 options which do take an argument must be the last option in their
 group, because everything following the option will be considered to
 be its argument.



Source package: libggi
Package: libggi-samples
Description: General Graphics Interface sample programs
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains some sample programs demonstrating LibGGI's
 capabilities:
 .
  "ggiteleserver" is a remote display server for the tele target.
  "ggi-cube3d" runs up to 6 GGI programs on a moveable cubes surfaces.
  "ggi-monitest" creates useful testpatterns.
Package: libggi-target-aa
Description: General Graphics Interface ASCII Art display target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains the driver for the "aa" target, enabling libGGI
 (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display its output as
 ASCII art.
Package: libggi-target-emu
Description: General Graphics Interface colour emulation targets
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains drivers for two colour-emulation pseudo-targets,
 enabling libGGI (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display
 its output in a different colour mode than the underlying physical
 target supports.  Two targets are included:
 .
  "palemu" emulates a palette-based display on a true-colour target
  "trueemu" emulates a true-colour display using a palette-based target
Package: libggi-target-fbdev
Description: General Graphics Interface direct access framebuffer target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains the driver for the "fbdev" target, enabling
 libGGI (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display its output
 on the kernel framebuffer device.  The framebuffer device is the usual
 means of displaying graphics on most non-i386 architectures, and, for
 i386, kernels in the stable 2.2 kernel series contain a working i386
 framebuffer device.
Package: libggi-target-glide
Description: General Graphics Interface Glide2 display target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains the driver for the "glide" target, enabling libGGI
 (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display its output on a
 3dfx Voodoo 2, Voodoo Banshee, or Voodoo 3 graphics card.
 .
 Because libglide2 needs direct access to hardware, any program using
 it may have to be run SetUID root or provision to be taken that the user
 running such a program has proper access rights.  Programs using libGGI
 are not normally installed SetUID root, so you will have to arrange that
 if you want to use this target.
Package: libggi-target-monotext
Description: General Graphics Interface plain text target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains the driver for the "monotext" target, enabling
 libGGI (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display its output
 as ASCII art.  This driver does not use the "aalib" ASCII art library;
 "monotext" is an independent implementation of the same idea.
 .
 The monotext target requires a text-capable target, such as the
 "terminfo" target, to display its output.
Package: libggi-target-svgalib
Description: General Graphics Interface SVGAlib display target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains the driver for the "svga" target, enabling libGGI
 (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display its output on the
 Linux console via SVGAlib.
 .
 Because SVGAlib needs direct access to hardware, any program using
 it must be run SetUID root.  Programs using libGGI are not normally
 installed SetUID root, so you will have to arrange that if you want to
 use this target.
Package: libggi-target-terminfo
Description: General Graphics Interface TermInfo display target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains the driver for the "terminfo" target, enabling
 libGGI (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display its
 output in text mode.  This target does not support graphics; it only
 makes text modes available.  (However, you can display graphics on a
 text-mode target using the "monotext" target.)  Output is displayed in
 a terminal-independent fashion using the "ncurses" library.
Package: libggi-target-vcsa
Description: General Graphics Interface direct access console text target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains a driver for the "vcsa" target, enabling libGGI
 (and therefore any program using libGGI) to display text output on the
 Linux console.  It uses direct access to the "/dev/vcsa*" devices.
Package: libggi-target-x
Description: General Graphics Interface X display target
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains three drivers enabling libGGI (and therefore any
 program using libGGI) to display its output on an X server:
 .
  "X" draws its raster output into an X window
  "xlib" does the same as "X", except that it tries to use X primitives
      where possible to speed up drawing
  "dga" uses the XFree86 Direct Graphics Access X extension to speed up
      drawing -- this only works on local displays, and is not available
      on some architectures
Package: libggi2
Description: General Graphics Interface runtime libraries
 The GGI project is developing the "General Graphics Interface", a
 set of APIs, drivers and other interfaces aiming to provide a fast,
 portable graphics environment for UNIX-like operating systems.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries for libGGI, the lowest-level
 drawing library provided by GGI.  Also included are libGGI drivers for
 these targets:
 .
  "memory" draws into hidden in-memory framebuffers
  "ipc" draws into attached shared memory framebuffers
  "multi" draws output onto multiple displays simultaneously
  "tile" combines several displays into a single logical display
  "sub" draws output into a subwindow on another target
  "file" draws into a specially formatted file (?)
  "tele" draws on a remote teleserver (?)
 .
 Since none of the targets included here are, alone, capable of real,
 physical graphics output, you'll probably need to install at least one
 of the libggi-target packages to make any kind of sensible use of libGGI.

 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Package: libhsync0
Description: Implements the `hsync' protocol
 libhsync is a reference implementation of the hsync extensions to HTTP.
 hsync makes the web work faster, by caching documents and transferring
 only the differences between the cached version and the current version.
 .
 This works particularly well for dynamically-generated sites, where the
 pages are often similar but not the same on each visit. Transferring just
 the difference reduces network traffic and therefore loading time.
 .
 This library by itself is likely not useful. You will need a hsync client,
 of which, rsync is one.

 logos) can be extracted into their own components where they need be
 changed only once to affect the whole site.
 .
 Other Mason features include a graphical site previewing utility, an
 HTML/data caching model, and the ability to walk through requests with
 the Perl debugger.



Source package: libhtml-parser-perl

Source package: libhtml-simpleparse-perl
Package: libhtml-simpleparse-perl
Description: perl HTML::SimpleParse - a bare-bones HTML parser.
 It is a bare-bones HTML parser, similar to HTML::Parser, but with
 a couple important distinctions:
 .
 First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which start
 tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in the <HEAD>
 portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse does not know any
 of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it, it
 does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does
 distiguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting
 tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on).
 .
 Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
 content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to
 balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags are
 inside other pairs of tags.



Source package: libhtml-table-perl
Package: libhtml-table-perl
Description: Perl module for creating HTML tables
 HTML::Table is used to generate HTML tables for
 CGI scripts.  By using the methods provided fairly
 complex tables can be created, manipulated, then printed
 from Perl scripts.  The module also greatly simplifies
 creating tables within tables from Perl.  It is possible
 to create an entire table using the methods provided and
 never use an HTML tag.
 .
 HTML::Table also allows for creating dynamically sized
 tables via its addRow and addCol methods.  These methods
 automatically resize the table if passed more cell values
 than will fit in the current table grid.
 .
 Methods are provided for nearly all valid table, row, and
 cell tags specified for HTML 3.0.

 extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>,
 <TMPL_LOOP>, <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>.  The file
 written with HTML and these new tags is called a template.  It is
 usually saved separate from your script - possibly even created by
 someone else!  Using this module you fill in the values for the
 variables, loops and branches declared in the template.  This allows
 you to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you generate
 in the Perl script.



Source package: libhtml-tree-perl
Package: libhtml-tree-perl

Source package: libirman
Package: libirman-dev
Description: library for accessing the IRMAN hardware.
 libirman is a library for accessing the IRMAN hardware from Linux and other
 Unix systems.
 .
 For general applications programming, the preferred interface for infra-red
 control is `lirc', as lirc supports multiple programs sharing the same
 infra-red receiver.  It does this by providing a socket based interface to
 which several programs can connect.
 .
 lirc uses libirman to interface with the Irman hardware, so in single use
 applications directly using libirman is simpler and uses less system
 resources.  Currently, lirc only works on Linux systems, so programs written
 using libirman directly are more portable.
 .
 NOTE: This debian package is mainly provided so that Irman support can be
 enabled in lirc package and there is no libirman0 because upstream doesn't
 build a shared library.

Source package: libquantum-entanglement-perl
Package: libquantum-entanglement-perl
Description: Quantum Mechanic entanglement of variables in perl
 One of the more popular interpretations of quantum mechanics holds that
 instead of particles always being in a single, well defined, state
 they instead exist as an almost ghostly overlay of many different
 states (or values) at the same time.  Of course, it is our experience
 that when we look at something, we only ever find it in one single state.
 This is explained by the many states of the particle collapsing to a
 single state and highlights the importance of observation.
 .
 Essentially, this allows you to put variables into a superposition
 of states, have them interact with each other (so that all states
 interact) and then observe them (testing to see if they satisfy
 some comparison operator, printing them) which will collapse
 the entire system so that it is consistent with your knowledge.



Source package: libquantum-superpositions-perl
Package: libquantum-superpositions-perl

Source package: libunicode-map-perl
Package: libunicode-map-perl
Description: Perl module for mapping charsets from and to utf16 unicode
 This module converts strings from and to 2-byte Unicode UCS2 format.
 All mappings happen via 2 byte UTF16 encodings, not via 1 byte UTF8
 encoding.  To convert between UTF8 and UTF16 use Unicode::String.
 .
 For historical reasons this module coexists with Unicode::Map8.
 Please use Unicode::Map8 unless you need to care for >1 byte
 character sets, e.g. chinese GB2312.  Anyway, if you stick to the
 basic functionality (see documentation) you can use both modules
 equivalently.
 .
 You need the libwww-perl package to run the example mirrorMappings.

Source package: libunicode-maputf8-perl
Package: libunicode-maputf8-perl
Description: Perl module for conversing between any character sets and UTF8
 This module provides an adapter layer between core routines for
 converting to and from UTF8 and other encodings.  In essence, a way
 to give multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface
 so you don't have to know the underlying implementations to do
 simple UTF8 to-from other character set encoding conversions.  As
 such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8, Unicode::Map and
 Jcode modules in a standardized and simple API.
 .
 This also provides general character set conversion operation based
 on UTF8 - it is possible to convert between any two compatible and
 supported character sets via a simple two step chaining of
 conversions.
 .
 As with most things Perlish - if you give it a few big chunks of text
 to chew on instead of lots of small ones it will handle many more
 characters per second.
 .
 By design, it can be easily extended to encompass any new charset
 encoding conversion modules that arrive on the scene.

Source package: libxml-filter-detectws-perl
Package: libxml-filter-detectws-perl
Description: Perl module for detecting ignorable whitespace
 This module is a PerlSAX filter that detects which character data
 contains ignorable whitespace and optionally filters it.
 .
 The XML spec defines ignorable whitespace as the character data found
 in elements that were defined in an <!ELEMENT> declaration with a model
 of 'EMPTY' or 'Children' (Children is the rule that does not contain
 '#PCDATA').
 .
 In addition, XML::Filter::DetectWS allows the user to define other
 whitespace to be ignorable.  The ignorable whitespace is passed to
 the PerlSAX Handler with the ignorable_whitespace handler, provided
 that the Handler implements this method.  Otherwise it is passed to
 the characters handler.  If the SkipIgnorableWS is set, the ignorable
 whitespace is simply discarded.  XML::Filter::DetectWS also takes
 xml:space attributes into account.
 .
 CDATA sections are passed in the standard PerlSAX way (i.e. with
 surrounding start_cdata and end_cdata events), unless the Handler
 does not implement these methods.  In that case, the CDATA section is
 simply passed to the characters method.



Source package: libxml-filter-reindent-perl
Package: libxml-filter-reindent-perl
Description: Perl module for reformatting whitespace for pretty printing XML
 This module can be used as a PerlSAX filter to reformat an XML
 document before sending it to a PerlSAX handler that prints it (like
 XML::Handler::Composer).
 .
 Like XML::Filter::DetectWS, it detects ignorable whitespace and
 blocks of whitespace characters in certain places.  It uses this
 information and information supplied by the user to determine where
 whitespace may be modified, deleted or inserted.  Based on the indent
 settings, it then modifies, inserts and deletes characters and
 ignorable_whitespace events accordingly.
 .
 This is just a first stab at the implementation.  It may be buggy and
 may change completely!



Source package: libxml-filter-saxt-perl
Package: libxml-filter-saxt-perl
Description: Perl module for replicating events to several event handlers
 This module is like the Unix 'tee' command in that it multiplexes the
 input stream to several output streams.  In this case, the input
 stream is a PerlSAX event producer (like XML::Parser::PerlSAX) and
 the output streams are PerlSAX handlers or filters.
 .
 The SAXT constructor takes a list of hash references.  Each hash
 specifies an output handler.  The hash keys can be: DocumentHandler,
 DTDHandler, EntityResolver or Handler, where Handler is a combination
 of the previous three and acts as the default handler.  E.g. if
 DocumentHandler is not specified, it will try to use Handler.



Source package: libxml-filter-xslt-perl
Package: libxml-filter-xslt-perl
Description: Perl module for XSLT as a SAX Filter
 This module implements XSLT as a SAX Filter.  At the moment it only
 uses XML::LibXSLT as an XSLT transformer, but hopefully in the future
 we can support others too (it's written with that in mind).
 .
 The beauty is you can stick other things in the transformation chain
 if you want, or you can make the writer use XML::Handler::HTMLWriter
 if you want to write out valid HTML 4.0, or you can make the
 generator something like XML::Generator::DBI.  The possibilities are
 endless.



Source package: libxml-generator-perl
Package: libxml-generator-perl
Description: Perl module for generating XML files
 This is a simple module to help in the generation of XML. Basically,
 you create an XML::Generator object and then call a method for each
 tag, supplying the contents of that tag as parameters.



Source package: libxml-grove-perl
Package: libxml-grove-perl
Description: Perl module for accessing parsed *ML instances

 XML, HTML, or SGML instances using a tree of Perl hashes.  This
 package also includes several extensions to XML::Grove that provide
 the following:
 .
     * returning element contents as a string
     * returning element contents as XML, HTML, or Canonical XML
     * processing entire groves using the visitor pattern
     * processing entire groves using PerlSAX
     * running a filter over all nodes in the grove

 handler including ignorable_whitespace.



Source package: libxml-handler-trees-perl
Package: libxml-handler-trees-perl
Description: Perl module for building tree structures using PerlSAX handlers
 This module provides three PerlSAX handler classes for building tree
 structures.  XML::Handler::Tree builds the same type of tree as the
 "Tree" style in XML::Parser.  XML::Handler::EasyTree builds the same
 type of tree as the "EasyTree" style added to XML::Parser by
 XML::Parser::EasyTree.  XML::Handler::TreeBuilder builds the same
 type of tree as Sean M. Burke's XML::TreeBuilder.  These classes make
 it possible to construct these tree structures from sources other
 than XML::Parser.
 .
 All three handlers can be driven by either PerlSAX 1 or PerlSAX 2
 drivers.  In all cases, the end_document() method returns a reference
 to the constructed tree, which normally becomes the return value of
 the PerlSAX driver.



Source package: libxml-handler-yawriter-perl
Package: libxml-handler-yawriter-perl
Description: Perl module for writing XML documents

 .
 The model for this module is SAX2's NamespaceSupport class, readable
 at http://www.megginson.com/SAX/Java/javadoc/org/xml/sax/helpers/
 /NamespaceSupport.html.  It adds a few perlisations where thought to
 be appropriate.



Source package: libxml-node-perl
Package: libxml-node-perl
Description: Perl module for parsing XML files node based
 This module allows you to register callback functions or variables
 for any XML node.  If you register a call back function, it will be
 called when the node of the type you specified are encountered.  If
 you register a variable, the content of a XML node will be appended
 to that variable automatically.



Source package: libxml-parser-perl
Package: libxml-parser-perl
Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 This module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on top
 of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James
 Clark's expat library.  Each call to one of the parsing methods
 creates a new instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to
 parse the document.  Expat options may be provided when the
 XML::Parser object is created.  These options are then passed on to
 the Expat object on each parse call.  They can also be given as extra
 arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or
 Handlers options, or by setHandlers method.  These all provide
 mechanisms for XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by
 XML::Parser::Expat.  If neither Style nor Handlers are specified,
 then parsing just checks the document for being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first
 parameter the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Source package: libxml-twig-perl
Package: libxml-twig-perl
Description: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is build on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the <twig_roots|twig_roots and
 twig_print_outside_roots|twig_print_outside_roots options.  The
 finish|finish and finish_print|finish_print methods also help to
 increase performances.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.



Source package: libxml-um-perl
Package: libxml-um-perl
Description: Perl module for converting UTF-8 strings
 This module provides methods to convert UTF-8 strings to any XML
 encoding that XML::Encoding supports.  It creates mapping routines
 from the .xml files that can be found in the maps/ directory in the
 XML::Encoding distribution.  Note that the XML::Encoding distribution
 does install the .enc files in your perl directory, but not the.xml
 files they were created from.  That's why you have to specify $ENCDIR
 as in the SYNOPSIS.
 .
 This implementation uses the XML::Encoding class to parse the .xml
 file and creates a hash that maps UTF-8 characters (each consisting
 of up to 4 bytes) to their equivalent byte sequence in the specified
 encoding.  Note that large mappings may consume a lot of memory!
 .
 Future implementations may parse the .enc files directly, or do the
 conversions entirely in XS (i.e. C code).



Source package: libxml-writer-perl
Package: libxml-writer-perl
Description: Perl module for writing XML documents
 XML::Writer is a helper module for Perl programs that write an XML
 document.  The module handles all escaping for attribute values and
 character data and constructs different types of markup, such as
 tags, comments, and processing instructions.
 .
 By default, the module performs several well-formedness checks to
 catch errors during output.  This behaviour can be extremely useful
 during development and debugging, but it can be turned off for
 production-grade code.
 .
 The module can operate either in regular mode in or Namespace
 processing mode.  In Namespace mode, the module will generate
 Namespace Declarations itself, and will perform additional checks on
 the output.
 .
 Additional support is available for a simplified data mode with no
 mixed content: newlines are automatically inserted around elements
 and elements can optionally be indented based as their nesting
 level.



Source package: libxml-xerces-perl
Package: libxml-xerces-perl
Description: Perl API to Xerces XML parser
 Xerces.pm is the Perl API to the Apache project's Xerces XML parser. It is
 implemented using the Xerces C++ API, and it provides access to most of the C++
 API from Perl.
 .
 Because it is based on Xerces-C, Xerces.pm provides a validating XML parser
 that makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and write XML
 data. A shared library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating, and
 validating XML documents. Xerces.pm is faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation
 and associated standards (DOM 1.0, DOM 2.0. SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0, Namespaces, and
 Schema), The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability.



Source package: libxml-xpath-perl
Package: libxml-xpath-perl
Description: Perl module for processing XPath

 extensions through the use of functions and variables, such as are
 provided by XSLT and XPointer.



Source package: libxml-xql-perl
Package: libxml-xql-perl
Description: Perl module for querying XML tree structures with XQL
 This module implements the XQL (XML Query Language) proposal
 submitted to the XSL Working Group in September 1998.  The spec can
 be found at: http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/pp/xql.html.  Most of
 the contents related to the XQL syntax can also be found in the
 XML::XQL::Tutorial that comes with this distribution.  Note that XQL
 is not the same as XML-QL!
 .
 The current implementation only works with the XML::DOM module, but
 once the design is stable and the major bugs are flushed out, other
 extensions might follow, e.g. for XML::Grove.
 .
 XQL was designed to be extensible and this implementation tries to
 stick to that.  Users can add their own functions, methods,
 comparison operators and data types.  Plugging in a new XML tree
 structure (like XML::Grove) should be a piece of cake.



Source package: libxml-xslt-perl
Package: libxml-xslt-perl
Description: Perl module for processing XSLT

 An example of .xsession is in /usr/doc/logout-button/examples and if you
 edit it choosing your favorite window manager, it will try to find and
 use it. Remember to place it in ~you/.xsession and make it executable.
 If you don't edit it, it will try to find and use the fvwm2 window mgr.
 .
 X infrastructure has a mechanism which waits for some program to exit
 indicating the user wishes to end his X session. logout-button is
 the simplest form of such a "session manager".
 .
 The example .xsession file provided in the doc/examples directory
 picks a window manager to run, starts it in the background, optionally
 starts other clients (xterm, xearth, xfishtank) also in the background
 and finally starts the session manager (logout-button) in the foreground,
 replacing the process and process ID belonging to the shell interpreting
 the .xsession. Because the infrastructure of X is waiting for this process
 to exit, when logout-button is pushed, the session is ended.

Source package: lout
Package: lout
Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX.
 Lout is a document formatting system similar in style to LaTeX, i.e.
 it works with mark-up files - plain text files containing commands to
 control the formatting.
 .
 Lout offers a very full range of features, including
  o PostScript, PDF, and plain text output
  o optimal paragraph and page breaking
  o automatic hyphenation
  o PostScript EPS file inclusion and generation
  o equation formatting, tables, diagrams
  o rotation and scaling
  o sorted indexes, bibliographic databases
  o running headers and odd-even pages, automatic cross referencing
  o multilingual documents including hyphenation (most European languages are
    supported, including Russian),
  o formatting of C/C++ programs.
 .
 Lout may be extended by writing definitions which are much simpler than
 the equivalent troff or TeX macros.
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and it is
 much easier to understand how to do things in Lout (including writing
 definitions) than in TeX or LaTeX.  Lout's PostScript output is very small
 and clean.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.

Source package: lp-solve
Package: lp-solve
Description: Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
 The linear programming (LP) problem can be formulated as: Solve A.x >=
 V1, with V2.x maximal. A is a matrix, x a vector of (nonnegative)
 variables, V1 a vector called the right hand side, and V2 a vector
 specifying the objective function.
 .
 An integer linear programming (ILP) problem is an LP with the
 constraint that all the variables are integers.  In a mixed integer
 linear programming (MILP) problem, some of the variables are integer
 and others are real.
 .
 The program lp_solve solves LP, ILP, and MILP problems. It is slightly
 more general than suggested above, in that every row of A (specifying
 one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. The result
 specifies values for all variables.
 .
 lp_solve uses the 'Simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
 pure LP problems.  If one or more of the variables is declared
 integer, the Simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
 algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
 read MPS format input files.

Source package: lxr
Package: lxr
Description: Linux Cross-Reference
 The Linux Cross-Reference project is the testbed application of a
 general hypertext cross-referencing tool.  (Or the other way around.)

 The main goal of the project is to create a versatile
 cross-referencing tool for relatively large code repositories.  The
 project is based on stock web technology, so the codeview client may
 be chosen from the full range of available web browsers.  On the
 server side, any Unix-based web server with cgi-script capability
 should do nicely.
 .
 The main feature of the indexer is of course the ability to jump
 easily to the declaration of any global identifier.  Indeed, even all
 references to global identifiers are indexed.  Quick access to
 function declarations, data (type) definitions and preprocessor macros
 makes code browsing just that tad more convenient.  At-a-glance
 overview of e.g. which code areas that will be affected by changing a
 function or type definition should also come in useful during
 development and debugging.

Source package: mailagent
Package: mailagent
Description: An automatic mail-processing tool
 Mailagent allows you to process your mail automatically. This has
 far more functionality than procmail, and is easier to configure
 (providing, of course, that you grok perl). As a mail processing
 tool, this slices, it dices, it ...
 .
 Given a set of lex-like rules, you are able to file mails to specific
 folders (plain Unix-style folders and also MMDF and MH ones), forward
 messages to a third person, pipe a message to a command or even post
 the message to a newsgroup.
 .
 It is also possible to process messages containing some commands.
 .
 You may also set up a vacation program, which will automatically
 answer your mail while you are not there, but more flexibly than the
 Unix command of the same name. You only need to supply a message to
 be sent and the frequency at which this will occur. Some simple macro
 substitutions allow you to re-use some parts of the mail header into
 your vacation message, for a more personalized reply.
 .
 You may also set up a generic mail server, without the hassle of the
 lower-level concerns like error recovery, logging or command parsing.
 .
 The mailagent is not usually invoked manually but is rather called
 via the filter program, which is in turn invoked by sendmail. That
 means you must have sendmail/smail on your system to use this. You
 also must have perl to run the mailagent scripts.
 .
 It is possible to extend the mailagent filtering commands by
 implementing them in perl and then having them automagically loaded
 when used.
 .
 Please note that on Debian systems, mailagent can not lock /var/spool/mail
 directory mailboxes, and thus one must put a catch all rule saving all mail
 in ones home directory. This is because Debian MDA policy requires them to
 be setgid mail, and making anything as extensible as mailagent setgid
 anything negates any benefit of having group permission protection.



Source package: mailcheck

 mailboxes, and maildirs (a mail storing format introduced by Qmail).
 .
 maildrop can optionally read instructions from a file on how to filter
 incoming mail, and, based upon the instructions, deliver mail to alternate
 mailboxes, or forward it to somewhere else, like procmail. Unlike procmail,
 maildrop uses a structured filtering language that's a bit easier on the
 eyes.



Source package: mailfilter
Package: mailfilter
Description: A program that filters your incoming e-mail to help remove spam.

 downloading them to the local computer. It offers support for one or many
 POP3 accounts and is especially useful for dialup connections via modem,
 ISDN, etc. Install Mailfilter if you'd like to remove spam from your POP3 mail
 accounts.
 .
 With Mailfilter you can define your own filters (rules) to determine
 which e-mails should be delivered and which are considered waste. Rules
 are Regular Expressions, so you can make use of familiar options from
 other mail delivery programs such as e.g. procmail.
 .
 If you do not get your mail from a POP3-Server you don't need Mailfilter.

 delivery and at that point 8-bit text types can be handled
 natively.  Hence, the need for transfer-encodings is not present
 any more.
 .
 Only some cases are handled:
  - encoded header fields are decoded from QP or B encoding.

Description: Keeps FTP archives up-to-date
 Mirror uses the FTP protocol to locally duplicate remote host files and
 directories selected with Perl regular expressions.  By default transfers
 only files missing locally or whose remote sizes or time-stamps have changed.
 Can reduce directory download using compressed listings in ls-lR.gz files
 or further using compressed differences of daily listings in ls-lR.patch.gz
 files.  Amongst many flexible options it can gzip and split files.  Tracks
 large distant FTP archives accurately with low download volume. Simpler
 programs like "mirrordir" use less memory and may copy directory trees
 faster between local machines.

 times, and sticky bits are duplicated.  Devices, pipes, and symbolic
 and hard links are duplicated.  Files or directories that exist in
 the mirror directory that don't exist in the control directory are
 deleted.  It naturally descends into subdirectories to all their
 depths. mirrordir tries to be as efficient as possible by making the
 minimal set of changes necessary to mirror the directory.

Source package: mixal
Package: mixal
Description: A MIX emulator and MIXAL interpreter
 Mixal is an implementation of the imaginary computer called
 MIX and its assembly language MIXAL, which were invented
 by Donald E. Knuth in the 1960's for use in his monumental
 and yet unfinished book series "The Art of Computer Programming".
 All actual programs and all programming exercises in the series
 are written in MIXAL.
 .
 This package contains a modified version of Darius Bacon's Mixal
 implementation.  It takes a MIXAL source file, translates it to
 MIX machine code and then executes the resulting program, all in
 a single run.  The result of the assembler step cannot be extracted
 to a file.  Similarly, one cannot take a precompiled MIX program and
 try to execute it in this emulator - only MIXAL source is accepted.
 .
 The MIX emulator does not support floating-point operations

Source package: nmap
Package: nmap
Description: The Network Mapper
 nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works fine
 for single hosts.  The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap was
 TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It).  This is the Perl slogan, but
 it is equally applicable to scanners.  Sometimes you need speed, other times
 you may need stealth.  In some cases, bypassing firewalls may be required.
 Not to mention the fact that you may want to scan different protocols (UDP,
 TCP, ICMP, etc.).  You just can't do all this with one scanning mode.  And
 you don't want to have 10 different scanners around, all with different
 interfaces.  Thus I incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know
 into nmap.  Specifically, nmap supports:
 .
        Vanilla TCP connect() scanning,
        TCP SYN (half open) scanning,
        TCP FIN (stealth) scanning,
        TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning
        SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters),
        UDP recvfrom() scanning,
        UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning,
        ICMP scanning (ping-sweep), and
        Reverse-ident scanning.
 .
 nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such as
 dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission, parallel
 port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings, and flexible
 target and port specification.
Package: nmapfe

 set of programs that are run from the shell.  This allows the user to
 utilize the full power of the Unix shell in coordination with nmh.  Various
 front-ends are available, such as mh-e (an emacs mode), xmh, and exmh (X11
 clients).
 .
 nmh was originally based on MH version 6.8.3, and is intended to be a
 (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.



Source package: nms-formmail
Package: nms-formmail
Description: Send emails from web forms
 nms is an attempt to provide replacements for all of the scripts from
 Matt's Script Archive. MSA is probably the most well-known archive of
 CGI programs currently available on the web. Among the Perl community,
 the MSA scripts are known to be badly-written, buggy and insecure.
 .
 nms was started when a group of Perl programmers got tired of telling
 people not to use Matt's programs and getting the reply ``But what
 shall I use instead?''
 .
 formmail is a script which allows you to receive the results of an
 HTML form submission via an email message.



Source package: nn

 Using NTE can be very interactive - unless you lock a block of text,
 anyone else in your session can edit that text or delete it. This is
 intentional. Many people can (if they wish) edit the same document
 simultaneously. Many people can even edit the same block of text
 simultaneously, but if more than one person tries to edit the same
 line at one time, a conflict will occur, which results in only one of
 the changes being preserved.

Package: ntp
Description: Daemon and utilities for full NTP v4 timekeeping participation.
 The Network Time Protocol allows for the synchronization of clocks on
 networked computers.  The ntpd daemon implements NTP, allowing Unix
 systems to participate in this synchronization.
 .
 NTP was designed with attention to details which might introduce
 systematic bias into the computations, and the protocol is capable of
 synchronizing with even the most precise external time sources.
 .
 For more information on how NTP works, and how to configure a campus of
 ntpd daemons, load the optional Debian package 'ntp-doc'.
 .
 The Perl suggestion is only to allow use of the entirely optional ntpsweep
 utility.  Feel free to ignore it if you just want the daemon.

 The use of ntpdate is optional if you're running the ntp package, it can help
 a system obtain lock if it starts with a time that's pretty close by using
 ntpdate before starting the daemon.
 .
 The ntpdate client by itself is useful for occasionally setting the time on
 machines that are not on the net full-time, such as laptops.

     Simple, powerful set of classes.  Very portable.
     Can be used to develop with different compilers, then
     port with 'objc'.  Compatible with ICpak101, the collection class
     library described in Brad Cox' book, and used by existing
     Objective-C packages that were developed with Stepstone objc.
   - "cakit", the "Computer Algebra Kit" Objective C classes

Source package: ocaml
Package: ocaml
Description: ML language implementation with a class-based object system
 Objective Caml is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 Objective Caml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.

Source package: ocamlweb
Package: ocamlweb
Description: literate programming tool for Objective Caml
 Literate programming, as defined by Knuth, means to combine program
 code and documentation into one source document from which program
 code and documentation can be extracted. The approach of ocamlweb is
 that documentation is to be included in the program code as special
 comments. The ocamlweb tool extracts from this the documented program
 code as LaTeX document, while no special preprocessing is required to
 compile the source files.

Source package: omirr
Package: omirr
Description: Online Mirror Daemon
 Duplicates directory hierarchies between several machines.
 The omirr package consists of the online mirror daemon in.omirrd and a
 kernel patch.  The daemon supports mirroring of directory hierarchies
 between several machines.  It distributes files, file contents and
 file attributes to remote machines, comparable to the rdist(1)
 program, but it has several differences compared to rdist.
 .
 Firstly, it synchronizes the files online, usually immediately, using
 an interface to the local kernel which notifies the daemon about all
 file system modifications. This results in equivalent file system
 contents of the mirrored hierarchies on all machines. The daemon is
 started once, usually at boot time and then runs continuously. In
 contrast, the rdist program is started manually or from cron, then
 distributes its files and terminates.
 .
 Secondly, it allows symmetric mirroring. With rdist, one file system
 hierarchy is the master version used to update the others. The
 hierarchies synchronized by in.omirrd are all treated equally,
 i.e. there is no master copy. The file system modifications are
 time-stamped and in.omirrd uses the latest version of each file. This
 is the same as concurrently modifying the same file from two Unix
 processes: the last modification takes effect. But, since in.omirrd
 does not support file (or even record) locking, it should not be used
 for file system hierarchies with a lot of concurrent updates on
 several machines or for files usually accessed using locking
 mechanisms, like database files.
 .
 Thirdly, it can synchronize several remote machines concurrently.
 rdist updates multiple hosts sequentially.

Source package: panorama
Package: panorama
Description: A framework for 3D graphics production
 Panorama will include modeling, rendering, post-processing,
 animating, etc.  Functionally, it is structured as an API, composed
 by two dynamic libraries, and several plugins, that you can
 optionally load in runtime.  A simple console mode front-end for this
 API is included in the package, that can load a scene description in
 one of the supported scene languages and then outputs a single image
 file in any of the supported graphic formats.
 .
 Its main features are:
 .
   - Plugin architecture. Most elements in the system are
     plugin's. This means components are loaded as needed, and can be
     substituted, added, etc without recompiling anything. This will
     let third parties distribute their plugins outside the main
     distribution.
 .
   - Object oriented scene description language, with classes,
     inheritance, etc. It's easy to use, and has a simple syntax.
 .
   - Scene language is a plugin itself, so any other scene language
     can be used instead.
 .
   - Several rendering methods are possible without any other change
     in input scene file. Currently supported methods are raytracing
     and zbuffer, but other methods are being tested and will be
     incorporated in the future.
 .
   - A postprocessing system lets you apply filters to the whole image
     after it has been generated by renderer.
 .
   - Similarly, there are object filters, that you can apply to an
     object in the rendering process. This means a new class of
     effects (e.g. a cartoon-like object in a photorealistic scene).
 .
   - Materials have a BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution
     Function) that encapsulates its properties with respect to the
     light. Now, only Lambertian and Phong BSDF's are implemented, but
     more sophisticated ones will follow, like Schlick's, Ward's, etc.

Source package: pbuilder
Package: pbuilder
Description: personal package builder for Debian packages
 pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
 chroot. It is an ideal system to use to check that a package's
 build-dependencies are correct, and to be sure that unnecessary and
 wrong build dependencies will not exist in the resulting package.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
 .
 "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image.
 .
 "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running
 pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.

Source package: pdl
Package: pdl
Description: The perl data language. Perl extensions for numerics.
 PDL (``Perl Data Language'') gives standard perl the ability to COMPACTLY
 store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data arrays
 which are the bread and butter of scientific computing.  The idea
 is to turn perl in to a free, array-oriented, numerical language
 in the same sense as commercial packages like IDL and MatLab. One
 can write simple perl expressions to manipulate entire numerical arrays
 all at once. For example, using PDL the perl variable $a can hold a
 1024x1024 floating point image, it only takes 4Mb of memory to store
 it and expressions like $a=sqrt($a)+2 would manipulate the whole image
 in a few seconds.
 .
 A simple interactive shell (perldl) is provided for command line use
 together with a module (PDL) for use in perl scripts.

Source package: pdnsd
Package: pdnsd
Description: Proxy DNS Server
 pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache contents are
 written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope with unreachable or
 down dns servers (for example in dial-in networking).
 pdnsd can be used with applications that do dns lookups, eg on startup, and
 can't be configured to change that behaviour, to prevent the often minute-long
 hangs (or even crashes) that result from stalled dns queries.
 Some Netscape Navigator versions for Unix, for example, expose this behaviour.
 .
 And it's IPv6 capable.

 This package enables the user to create ISO images for burning to
 recordable CD and DVD media containing a bootable installer (PGI) which
 guides the user through the steps of installation.  The installer supports
 text and graphical installation modes.  PGI runs debootstrap to install a
 minimal Debian system to the target filesystem(s), sets up a boot loader
 (if the installing user requests), and uses the pivot_root() system call
 to "boot" into the installed system.  ISO images may be generated with
 complete or partial Debian package archives, or with only the installer
 (useful for network-only installs, which PGI supports.)

Source package: pkg-order
Package: pkg-order
Description: A Package dependency checker and install ordering tool
 It does dependency checks, if you wish. It knows the difference
 between installed, new (and available) packages, and the relationship
 fields (pre-depends, depends, recommends, and suggests). (For
 example, the current packages list need not be read in unless you
 want dependency checks; you may already have done that and now merely
 wish an ordering). It comes with a Test::Harness test suite, to
 protect the world against my typos. Oh, it knows about epochs as well
 if your dpkg does. This could be the basis of mass compiling the
 packages on a new architecture, or to build a release from scratch.
 .
 It creates associative arrays of currently installed packages
 (/var/lib/dpkg/status), and new packages (given a packages file at
 the command line). Then, in the checking dependency phase, for each
 package in the new packages list, it looks at the dependencies, and
 ensure that each dependency is satisfied in either the new list or
 the installed list. If the directive is satisfied from the list of
 new packages, that package is added to the list of packages to be
 topographically sorted. It understands Pre-Depends and will insert
 breaks into the sorted list to separate the installation process into
 separate runs as required to satisfy Pre-Dependencies.
 .
 All this is a set of perl5 libraries, so people may use the API in
 their own scripts.

Package: pm3
Description: Polytechnique Montreal Modula-3
 The Modula-3 distribution of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal is based
 on the DEC SRC Modula-3 programming environment.
 .
 Modula-3 is a systems programming language that descends from Mesa,
 Modula-2, Cedar, and Modula-2+. It also resembles its cousins Object
 Pascal, Oberon, and Euclid.
 .
 The goal of Modula-3 is to be as simple and safe as it can be while
 meeting the needs of modern systems programmers. Instead of exploring new
 features, they studied the features of the Modula family of languages
 that have proven themselves in practice and tried to simplify them into
 a harmonious language. They found that most of the successful features
 were aimed at one of two main goals: greater robustness, and a simpler,
 more systematic type system.
 .
 Modula-3 retains one of Modula-2's most successful features, the
 provision for explicit interfaces between modules. It adds objects and
 classes, exception handling, garbage collection, lightweight processes
 (or threads), and the isolation of unsafe features.
 .
 A large number of platform independent libraries are available for easily
 constructing distributed, graphical, multi-threaded applications.

Source package: psgml
Package: psgml
Description: An Emacs major mode for editing SGML documents.
 PSGML is a major mode for editing SGML documents.  It contains a
 simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. (The most popular
 nowadays are the HTML DTDs. This package turns your emacs into the
 one of most powerful HTML editors and will be ultimately flexible as
 well, since you could upgrade your editor by just installing new
 DTDs). Functions provided includes menus and commands for inserting
 tags with only the contextually valid tags, identification of
 structural errors, editing of attribute values in a separate window
 with information about types and defaults, and structure based
 editing.
 .
 Since psgml parses the DTD to allow you to edit SGML documents, you do
 need to have the DTDs installed in order to use psgml. Since psgml
 installs itself as an HTML mode in Emacs, it depends on sgml-data. Some
 other packages which also provide SGML DTDs are suggested, like
 debiandoc-sgml and linuxdoc-sgml.
 .
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO
 standard: ISO 8879:1986 "Information processing - Text and office
 systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)".
 .
 Psgml is a standard package for XEmacs, and thus this package does not
 install itself for XEmacsen.

Source package: py-xmlrpc
Package: python-xmlrpc
Description: Implementation of the XML-RPC protocol for Python
 This XML-RPC client and server implementation is written in C and
 wrapped up in python. It's features are:
 .
 - Efficiency: This library seems to be 20x-100x faster than other
 xmlrpc libraries. It has been benchmarked at about 1000 RPC calls per
 second between two different celeron 466 machines. Both speed and
 memory use seem to be exponentially better (related to the size of
 objects being sent across) than the existing Python libraries.
 .
 - Non-Blocking IO: This becomes important when you have critical
 applications (especially servers) that CANNOT be held up because a
 client is trickling a request in or is reading a response at 1 byte
 per second.
 .
 - Event based: This goes hand in hand with non-blocking IO. It lets
 you use an event based model for your client/server application,
 where the main body is basically the select loop on the file
 descriptors you are interested in. The work is done by registering
 callbacks for different events you received on file descriptors. This
 can be very nice. There is some work to be done here, but all the
 hooks are in place. See TO DO for a list of the features that have
 yet to be incorporated.
 .
 - Portable: Source should be compatible on both windows and POSIX
 .
 This package is normally known by the name py-xmlrpc, but has been
 renamed for Debian policy compliance.

Source package: python-extclass
Package: python-extclass
Description: Improves integration between Python and C++ classes
 A lightweight mechanism, named "ExtensionClass",
 http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/ExtensionClass-1.0.2.tar.gz,
 has been developed for making Python
 extension types more class-like.  Classes can be developed in an
 extension language, such as C or C++, and these classes can be
 treated like other python classes:
 .
  - They can be sub-classed in python,
  - They provide access to method documentation strings, and
  - They can be used to directly create new instances.
 .
 An example class shows how extension classes are implemented and how
 they differ from extension types.
 .
 Extension classes provide additional extensions to class and
 instance semantics, including:
 .
  - A protocol for accessing subobjects "in the context of" their
    containers.  This is used to implement custom method types
    and environmental acquisition.
  - A protocol for overriding method call semantics.  This is used
    to implement "synchronized" classes and could be used to
    implement argument type checking.
  - A protocol for class initialization that supports execution of a
    special '__class_init__' method after a class has been
    initialized.
 .
 Extension classes illustrate how the Python class mechanism can be
 extended and may provide a basis for improved or specialized class
 models.

Source package: rawrec
Package: rawrec
Description: Buffered raw audio recorder/player
 The rawrec/rawplay utilities provide a simple way to record or play
 back raw audio data.  Options exist to control the timing of the run,
 add silent guard time, jump into data files, set DSP parameters, and
 control buffer size and latency.  rawrec should be particularly useful
 for scripting applications that need to deal with raw audio data.
 .
 Compared to bplay, rawrec tries to do less (it only handles raw
 audio) and does it more correctly (all the options work right for raw
 audio.  I think :).
 .
 rawrec can work to or from standard io, so if you also get the sox
 program, you will be able to record and play a wide variety of sound
 formats.  You will need a mixer program, such as aumix.



Source package: razor
Package: razor
Description: spam-catcher using a collaborative filtering network
 Vipul's Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and
 filtering network. Razor establishes a distributed and constantly updating
 catalogue of spam in propagation. This catalogue is used by clients to
 filter out known spam. On receiving a spam, a Razor Reporting Agent (run
 by an end-user or a troll box) calculates and submits a 20-character unique
 identification of the spam (a SHA Digest) to its closest Razor
 Catalogue Server. The Catalogue Server echos this signature to other
 trusted servers after storing it in its database. Prior to manual
 processing or transport-level reception, Razor Filtering Agents (end-users
 and MTAs) check their incoming mail against a Catalogue Server and filter
 out or deny transport in case of a signature match. Catalogued spam, once
 identified and reported by a Reporting Agent, can be blocked out by the
 rest of the Filtering Agents on the network.

Description: Tool to Query RBL Servers
 This program is a very basic interface to DNS listings such as the RBL
 filter developed by Paul Vixie and the MAPS project. The basic idea of the
 filter is that when someone is blacklisted for email abuse of some sort, a
 new domain name is resolved of the form "2.0.0.127.domain.name.com", where
 2.0.0.127 is the abusive IP address in reverse (for example, 2.0.0.127
 would be the IP address 127.0.0.2), and "domain.name.com" is the base
 domain name of the filtering service (such as "blackholes.mail-abuse.org"
 for the MAPS project RBL filter).

Source package: rdiff-backup
Package: rdiff-backup
Description: Backup program to use deltas for history
 rdiff-backup is a script that backs up one directory to another. The target
 directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs
 are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can
 still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best
 features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves
 subdirectories, symlinks, special files, permissions, uid/gid ownership (if
 it is running as root), and modification times. Finally, rdiff-backup can
 operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you
 can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive up to a remote
 location, and only the differences will be transmitted.

 users whose e-mails pass through a UNIX-like mail server. Many modern
 viruses are spread through e-mail, and renattach combats such viruses by
 filtering e-mail attachments based on file extension. In version 1.1.1,
 the MIME type is also renamed. The idea is to rename potentially
 dangerous attachments (executable ones) so that the user, or the user's
 poorly written e-mail software, does not accidentally execute the
 attachment.

 documentation in the source code and avoid having to maintain two
 separate documents.  Or as Petteri puts it: "robodoc is very useful -
 especially for programmers who don't like writing documents with Word or
 some other strange tool."
 .
 ROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats:
 HTML, ASCII, AmigaGuide, LaTeX, or RTF. In HTML mode it can
 generate cross links between headers. You can even include parts
 of your source code.
 .
 ROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C,
 Pascal, Shell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript,
 Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++, Java -- basically any program in which you
 can use remarks/comments.

Description: A tool for building complete Linux filesystem images
 Rootstrap was originally written to provide a facility for building
 filesystems for use with User-mode Linux, but can be useful in other

 image, install a base system, and customize it for a particular
 application.  Currently, it only builds Debian systems, but the
 architecture is such that other base systems could be used instead.
 .
 Use of rootstrap does not require root access, or special privileges
 of any kind.  This is because it builds the filesystem inside a
 User-mode Linux system running under an
 unprivileged uid.
 .
 Filesystem creation with rootstrap is quick and painless.  With a
 local mirror and a single command, a fresh Debian woody filesystem
 can be created in about 3 minutes on relatively modest hardware.

Source package: rproxy
Package: rproxy
Description: A cache which uses differences to speed up retrievals
 rproxy stores hashed values of retrieved pages and when you next
 access the same page it computes the difference between the
 current page and the recently stored page.
 .
 The rproxy extensions to HTTP allow the server to generate a hsync
 relative to the cached instance in a way that is completely general,
 and transparent to both the server and user agent.
 .
 rproxy, and clients and servers which implement hsync, calculate a
 block-by-block signature of the file, by computing a checksum over
 consecutive extents of equal length, such as 1024 bytes. This checksum
 is then added into a header of the request and transmited as usual.
 .
 To be useful, there should be at least two rproxy instances between
 the client and the server. Transfers between the proxies will be
 delta-encoded, while the browser and server will just see standard HTTP.
 For example, it is very useful to run on instance on each side of a modem
 link, so that data across the slow link will be delta-encoded. Further
 information is available at http://linuxcare.com.au/rproxy/

Source package: sam
Package: libxg-dev
Description: graphics libraries from plan9
 libXg.a, libframe.a and /usr/share/man/man3 extracted from sam.  These provide
 a simplified graphics interface which looks much simpler than X.  If
 anyone actually uses this for anything, we can then rebuild this with
 shared libraries.
 .
 If you plan on doing development with libXg, you'll probably want to
 have a copy of sam installed (for the file format man pages) or a copy
 of sam's source (which, of course, also has example code).
Package: sam
Description: the plan9 text editor -- ed with a gui and multi-file editing
 sam -d can be used without X (with an ed-like interface -- but with
 more powerful regular expressions, the capacity to edit multiple files
 with a single command, and unlimited undo).  Files can be added to an
 exiting sam session using the B command.
 .
 sam without the -d option is an graphical editor with pop-up menus and
 a point+click interface. You'll want to read sam's manual page to use
 the full power of sam, but you can probably figure out how to do basic
 editing with a minimum of trial and error.
 .
 If you have a Plan 9 terminal, you can use the Plan 9 terminal with
 sam to edit unix files, but not vice-versa; the Plan 9 authentication
 scheme does not honor remote execution requests from a non-Plan 9
 system.

Source package: sanitizer
Package: sanitizer
Description: The Anomy Mail Sanitizer - an email virus scanner
 The Anomy sanitizer is what most people would call "an email virus scanner".
 That description is not totally accurate, but it does cover one of the more
 important jobs that the sanitizer can do for you - it can scan email
 attachments for viruses. Other things it can do:
 .
 Disable potentially dangerous HTML code, such as javascript, within
 incoming email.
 .
 Protect you from email-based break-in attempts which exploit bugs in
 common email programs (Outlook, Eudora, Pine, ...).
 .
 Block or "mangle" attachments based on their file names. This way if you
 don't *need* to receive e.g. visual basic scripts, then you don't have to
 worry about the security risk they imply (the ILOVEYOU virus was a
 visual basic program). This lets you protect yourself and your users
 from whole classes of attacks, without relying on complex, resource
 intensive and outdated virus scanning solutions.

Source package: sash
Package: sash
Description: Stand-alone shell.
 sash serves as an interactive substitute for /bin/sh, for use when
 /bin/sh is unusable.  It's statically linked, and inludes many standard
 utilities as builtins (type "help" at the prompt for a reference list).
 If you've installed sash before rendering your system unbootable, and
 you have some knowledge of how your system is supposed to work, you might
 be able to repair your system using init=/bin/sash at the boot prompt.
 .
 Some people also prefer to have sash available as the shell for a
 root account (perhaps an under an alternate name such as sashroot)
 Configuration support is included for people who want this.
 .
 Note: sash is not intended to serve as /bin/sh, and has few of the
 interactive features present in bash or ksh.  It's designed to be simple
 and robust, for people who need to do emergency repair work on a system.
 .
 Also note: sash doesn't include a built-in fsck -- fsck is too big
 and complicated.  If you need fsck, you'll have to get at least one
 partition or disk working well enough to run fsck.  More generally,
 sash is but one tool of many (backups, backup recovery tools, emergency
 boot disks or partitions, spare parts, testing of disaster plans,
 etc.) to help you recover a damaged system.

Source package: scsh
Package: scsh
Description: A `scheme' interpreter designed for writing system programs.
 Scsh has a high-level process notation for doing shell-script like
 tasks: running programs, establishing pipelines and I/O redirection.
 Scsh embeds this process notation within a full Scheme
 implementation.  The process notation is realized as a set of macro
 definitions, and is carefully designed to allow full integration with
 standard Scheme code.  Scsh isn't Scheme-like; it is Scheme.
 .
 At the scripting level, scsh also has an Awk design, also implemented
 as a macro that can be embedded inside general Scheme code.
 .
 Scsh additionally provides the low-level access to the operating
 system normally associated with C. The current release provides full
 access to POSIX, plus important non-POSIX extensions, such as
 complete sockets support. "Complete POSIX" means: fork, exec & wait,
 sockets, full read, write, open & close, seek & tell, complete
 file-system access, including stat, chmod/chgrp/chown, symlink, FIFO
 & directory access, tty & pty support, file locking, pipes, select,
 file-name pattern-matching, time & date, environment variables,
 signal handlers, and more.
 .
 Please be aware that several of the other scheme implementations
 being distributed as Debian GNU/Linux packages also provide much of
 the similar system programming functionality.  It is wisest to try
 them all and explore.

Package: sendmail
Description: A powerful, efficient, and scalable Mail Transport Agent.
 Sendmail is an alternative Mail Transport Agent (MTA) for Debian.
 It is suitable for handling sophisticated mail configurations,
 although this means that its configuration can also be complex.
 Fortunately, easy thing can be done easily, and complex things
 are possible, even if not easily understood ;)  Sendmail is the *ONLY*
 MTA with a Turing complete language under the covers !
 .
 Sendmail provides Security and SPAM/UCE/UBE protection via several means:
  - SMTP AUTH (SASL/PAM) authentication for access/relay control.
  - ACCESS database (by IP/host) for access/relay control.
  - Use of varied Realtime Blackhole Lists (RBL) to prevent access.
  - Integration of LOGCHECK rules to fine-tune logging.
  - Inboard POSIX Regular Expression processing of *all* headers.
  - Ability (via MILTER) to scan/change headers *and* body of *ALL* mail
    A site may utilize zero, one, or more MILTERs.
  - Reduced SUID exposures by running SGID mail where possible.
 .
 Sendmail provides Performance and Scalability by:
  - Allowing multiple queues, with the ability to tune both interval and
    queue runners on a queue by queue basis.
  - Providing (a Debian exclusive) an easy to configure means of queue-aging
    to improve throughput by not continually retrying failed deliveries.
  - Allowing most all maps/databases to be obtained via LDAP; reducing the
    number of used databases and simplifying the maintenance of Sendmail.
  - Reducing the file I/O where possible by buffering files in memory.
 .
 Sendmail provides site enhanced site configuration/customization by:
  - Allowing the listener (usually port 25) to run as a daemon or via INETD.
  - Allowing the queue runner (mail delivery) to run as a daemon or via CRON.
  - Automagically updating configuration and databases on upgrades.
  - Providing a Turing complete language for site customization of mail
    handling.
  - Providing a means (MILTER) for a site to scan/change all email - both
    incoming and outgoing.  A site can write their own MILTER, or may use
    any of those found on internet.  To write your own MILTER, you'll need
    to install the optional milter-dev package.
  - Providing extensive documentation via the sendmail-doc (optional) package.
  - Providing an inboard Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) (mail.local), but supporting
    procmail, mailagent, maildrop, or deliver automatically if installed.
    Sendmail will also deliver to anythings else (cyrus, etc) if asked to.
 .
 Sendmail includes *no* Mail User Agents (MUA), you'll have to
 pick from the plethora of available MUAs (pine, mutt, vm, etc.)
 .
 This package supports REGEX, DB, NIS, NIS+, LDAP, DNS, HESIOD maps,
 and has enabled TCPWrappers, IPv6, LockFile, SMTP AUTH(SASL).
 .
 Whilst the source has STARTTLS (OpenSSL) support, binaries are *not* built
 with libSSL due to current Debian policy regarding crypto in main.

Source package: set6x86
Package: set6x86
Description: Cyrix/IBM 5x86/6x86 CPU configuration tool
 Allows one to modify the internal configuration registers in
 the 5x86 and 6x86 CPU. These include specifying non-cacheable
 memory areas (important for e.g. graphics cards), I/O delays,
 cache write policy (WB/WT), write-gathering, and also enable an
 automatic standby mode where a CPU "halt" instruction cuts down
 power by a factor of 70 (from 20 Watts to 0.3 Watts for the
 6x86 P133+) when the CPU is idle. Especially the CPU power
 reduction cuts down on most temperature-related problems on
 many motherboards.



Source package: setcd
Package: setcd
Description: Control the behaviour of your cdrom device
 This program allows you to control the behaviour of your Linux cdrom
 player.  You'll need a cdrom device that complies to the new interface
 defined in linux/Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex.  For
 kernel 2.0 this is only the cm206 drive, for kernel 2.1 this
 includes IDE and SCSI drives.
 .
 You can control: auto close, auto eject, medium type checking and
 tray locking.  You can get information on the volume name of cdroms
 and other data, and you can set the speed of your drive and choose a
 disc from a jukebox.
 .
 In order to fully exploit the possibilities, you'll need libc6 and a
 recent version of the the linux kernel, but you will get decent error
 behaviour in return.  Expect a message "No medium found" if you
 attempt to mount an empty drive or "Wrong medium type" if you try to
 mount an audio disc, instead of a whole load of kernel error
 messages.
 .
 The source of this package may be an example for cdrom player program
 developers that wish to exploit the features of the new cdrom
 interface.

Source package: setsccserial
Package: setsccserial
Description: Little tool to configure the SCC in an Atari
 This tool allows you to inform the kernel that your SCC has
 non-standard clock inputs. setSCCserial recalculates the clock/speed
 tables used by the kernel and thus allows you to take advantage of
 the modified clocks. You do NOT need setSCCserial if you haven't
 modified (in hardware) the clock inputs of your SCC. The kernel
 doesn't the right thing in this case anyway.



Source package: setserial
Package: setserial
Description: Controls configuration of serial ports.
 Set and/or report the configuration information associated with
 a serial port. This information includes what I/O port and which IRQ
 a particular serial port is using.
 .
 This version has a completely new approach to configuration, so if you
 have a setup other than the standard ttyS0 and 1, you will have to get
 your hands dirty.
 .
 By default, only COM1-4 are configured by the kernel, using IRQ 3 and 4.
 If you have other serial ports (such as an AST Fourport card), or
 if you have mapped the IRQs differently (perhaps COM3 and 4 to other
 IRQs to allow concurrent access with COM1 and 2) then you must have this
 package.

  * Automatic locking to avoid concurrent stream accesses,
  * I/O disciplines to pre/post-process read/write data from/to streams,
  * Stream stacking for recursive processing of nested streams,
  * Stream pooling for automatic stream synchronization when I/O operations
    are performed on different streams,
  * Buffer reservation for safe access to the internal buffers of streams,
  * Robust handling of variable-sized records, and
  * Extensible printf/scanf-like formatting I/O operations.

 A text-formatting package based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
 Language), which allows you to produce TeX/DVI/PS/PDF, HTML, RTF, and
 plain ASCII (currently via w3m by default) from a single source with
 other recommended and suggested packages; due to the flexible nature
 of SGML, many other target formats are possible.
 .
 This tool can not handle DocBook XML yet.  For DocBook SGML only.
 .
 HTML can be generated without any other Debian text processing package,
 but for the other formats the appropriate packages have to be installed.
 You need to install lynx or w3m for ASCII text output (w3m is the default
 for txt backend). Also jadetex is required also for PS and PDF, and
 linuxdoc-tools is required for ld2db conversion.

Source package: sipp
Package: sipp
Description: create and render 3-d scenes
 This is SIPP, the SImple Polygon Processor, version 3.1.  SIPP is a
 library for creating 3-dimensional scenes and rendering them using a
 scan-line z-buffer algorithm.  A scene is built up of objects which
 can be transformed with rotation, translation and scaling.  The
 objects form hierarchies where each object can have arbitrarily many
 subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a number of connected
 polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud or flat
 shading.  An image can also be rendered as a line drawing of the
 polygon edges without any shading at all.
 .
 The library supports texture mapping with textures in up to
 3-dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture coordinates.
 Simple anti-aliasing can be performed through oversampling.  A scene
 can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources and a
 number of different light sources are availaible.  The light from some
 of them are capable of casting shadows of objects.  A basic shading
 algorithm is provided with the library, but the user can also use his
 own shading algorithms for each surface to produce special effects.
 Objects can have varying degree of transparency, controlled by the
 shader.

Source package: smtm
Package: smtm
Description: Show Me The Money is a configurable Perl/Tk stock ticker program
 smtm, which is a not overly clever acronym for Show Me The Money, is a
 simple stock ticker application. It creates and automatically updates a
 window with stock quotes from Yahoo! Finance. When called with one or several
 stock symbols, it displays these selected stocks, and also records the
 symbols for later use. When smtm is called without arguments, it reads the
 symbols tickers from a (default or specified) file. This file can be created
 explicitly by calling the Save option from the File menu, or implicitly
 whenever smtm is called with one or more symbols.
 .
 smtm is fully configurable -- it can display the stock symbol and the full
 name of the company, the price change, the percentage change, the volume
 traded, the profit or loss, the value of the holding, the length of the
 holding period as well as annualised percentage returns. The display can be
 sort on almost any of the columns.  Losers are flagged in red. smtm can be
 used for North American equities, as well as European and Australian/NZ
 ones. It should work for other markets supported by Yahoo! Finance.
 .
 The quotes are delayed, typically 15 minutes for NASDAQ and 20 minutes
 otherwise, see Yahoo! Finance for details.



Source package: smtp-refuser
Package: smtp-refuser
Description: Simple spam-block with refusal message
 Smtp-refuser can be configured to reject mail from specific hosts
 (or that satisfy other tcpd hosts.allow or similar rules), returning a
 meaningful message including the reason it was bounced and a local phone
 number.  Because spam often has a bad envelope-from, (and because this
 is more efficient), we bounce it with an error message during the
 SMTP transaction, rather than send bounce mail later.
 .
 This SMTP refuser is used along with "tcpd" or (another TCP security
 daemon) to bounce messages from the IP addresses of known spammers. The
 advantage of this over just blocking the connection is that the remote
 SMTP server will not retry, and a legitimate e-mail sender will get a
 polite message telling them why their mail was blocked and whom to call
 to get around the blocking.
 .
 Mail that is not blocked by smtp-refuser is delivered to your standard
 mail transport agent.
 .
 Other, more automated solutions such as RBL and ORBS (supported by
 most of the mail transfer agents), have become available since
 smtp-refuser was written, but this may still be of interest to you.



Source package: smtpd
Package: smtpd
Description: Mail proxy for firewalls with anti-spam and anti-relay features
 Smtpd uses two programs, smtpd which listens for incoming mail and places
 it in a private queue, and smtpfwdd, which invokes sendmail to deliver
 messages from the queue. The configuration file for smtpd has powerful
 features for controlling the acceptance of incoming mail.
 .
 It is particularly useful for firewall sites, where the policy aspects of
 which mail should be accepted (in smtpd's configuration file) are clearly
 separated from the routing and other aspects of the mail configuration
 (which remain in the sendmail configuration file)
 .
 It can be used with any mail-transport-agent which can be invoked as sendmail
 but is intended to integrate with the Debian sendmail package, which
 recognises when smtpd has been installed.
 .
 If you are attempting to use it with an MTA other than sendmail then you
 will need to be prepared to modify the MTA configuration.



Source package: smtpfeed
Package: smtpfeed
Description: SMTP feed -- SMTP Fast Exploding External Deliver for Sendmail

Source package: stalin
Package: stalin
Description: An extremely aggressive Scheme compiler.
 stalin is an aggressive self-hosting Scheme compiler, designed to
 generate resource efficient stand-alone executables with very high
 computational performance.  It is a batch mode compiler like gcc, not
 an interpreter, and is designed to be used only after your code has
 stabilized.
 .
 It places a few limitations on the content of the source code.  For
 example, you may not not LOAD or EVAL new expressions or procedure
 definitions at runtime, but in exchange, it is able to perform
 various global analyses which may allow it to transparently map
 Scheme types to C types and to use native C arithmetic operations on
 a per-expression basis, whenever such operations are proven safe.
 Further stalin can often reduce or eliminate run-time type checking
 and dispatching, and omit garbage collection for data of limited
 scope or accessability, while omitting unreachable data altogether.
 .
 stalin also has a foreign procedure interface to both Xlib and OpenGL.

Source package: sup
Package: sup
Description: Software Upgrade Protocol implementation
 The SUP System is a set of programs developed by Carnegie Mellon
 University that provide for collections of files to be maintained in
 identical versions across a number of machines.  These programs are:
 .
 SUP: The "client" program, run by users or system maintainers, which
 initiates the upgrade activity  on  a  machine  requesting  the
 latest  version of a collection of files.  SUP will normally be
 run as a daemon, firing up once  each  night  (week,  etc.)  to
 upgrade the specified file collections.
 .
 SUPFILESRV: The "file server" program, a daemon that is run by the
 system maintainer to service requests for files initiated by client
 SUP programs.  The file server runs on every machine used as a
 "repository" of distributable versions of files.  It runs continuously
 and listens for network connection requests by individual client
 processes; for each individual client request, a process is forked to
 service that request.
 .
 SUPSCAN: The "file scanner" program, that may optionally be run
 periodically to speed up execution of the file server.  It
 pre-compiles a list of files on the file system that match the
 specifications for a given file collection so that the file server
 need not do this during each upgrade of that collection.  The file
 scanner is normally used daily for very large file collections that
 are upgraded by many clients each day; it is not so useful for small
 file collections or for those that are upgraded by only a few client
 machines per day.

Source package: surfraw
Package: surfraw
Description: a fast unix command line interface to WWW
 Surfraw - Shell Users' Revolutionary Front Rage Against the World Wide Web
 .

 popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
 google, altavista, dejanews, freshmeat, research index, slashdot
 and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen lands of
 html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in unix
 heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.
 .
 Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get
 on with what it's good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic
 forms is handed back to the shell, which is what it, and human
 beings are good at. Combined with incremental text browsers, such
 as links, w3m (or even lynx), and screen(1), or netscape-remote
 a Surfraw liberateur is capable of research speeds that leave

Package: svgalib-dummyg1
Description: Dummy replacement for svgalib1
 This package can replace the usual svgalib1 package, on which many
 other packages depend. Unfortunately, the proper svgalib1 requires
 some configuration and is a bit verbose, so if you don't need console
 graphics at all, and would install it only to satisfy dependencies,

 Using this library, you can run SVGAlib applications on any display
 target supported by LibGGI (except the real SVGAlib itself).
 .
 You should not attempt to compile SVGAlib applications against this
 wrapper library.  Install svgalibg1-dev or svgalib-dummyg1 for this.



Source package: svgatextmode
Package: svgatextmode
Description: Run higher resolution text modes.
 This program is designed to greatly improve the normal (EGA-based) textmodes
 on your Linux machine. It uses an Xconfig-like configuration file to set up
 better looking textmodes. (=higher resolution, larger font size, higher
 display refresh...) This is already a big boon on normal 14" displays, and
 it is an immense difference on larger and better (15" and up) screens.
 It stems from the idea that it is a real waste of hardware to use EGA
 textmodes on an SVGA-card, which was designed to do much better than that.
 .
 This package is mainly of use to people with older hardware that is not
 adequately supported by the Linux framebuffer drivers.  If you abhor 80x25
 text modes as much as I do but have a modern cpu and video hardware, then
 building a kernel with framebuffer support is probably a better option.
 Some newer video cards are not supported by this package at all (but are
 supported by the kernel fb drivers)
 .
 WARNING: This program will not work on non-VGA based systems.  Installing it
 will not do any harm, but activating the program can.



Source package: svncviewer
Package: svncviewer
Description: Virtual network computing client software for SVGA.
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `Desktop' environment

 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides a client
 for SVGA, with this you can connect to a vncserver somewhere in the network
 and display its content on a graphic capable console. There are vncserver
 available for X and for Win95/NT, although the Win95/NT server may not work
 with svgalib viewer due to missing palette handling.



Source package: swapd
Package: swapd
Description: Swap demon for dynamic swap file creation
 Swapd is a dynamic swapping manager for Linux. It provides the system with
 as much swap space (virtual memory) as is required at a particular time by
 dynamicly creating swap files. This is more convenient than using fixed swap
 files and/or partitions because they (a) are unused most of the time and are
 just taking up disk space; and (b) provide a limited amount of virtual memory.
 .
 On systems that have constant need for virtual memory it would still be
 wise to use a swap partition in parallel with dynamic swapping, since swap
 partitions provide much faster access than swap files.



Source package: swatch
Package: swatch
Description: log file viewer with regexp matching, highlighting, & hooks
 Swatch is designed to monitor system activity.  It reads a configuration
 file which contains pattern(s) to look for and action(s) to perform when

 built-in predicates and reasonable performance, which makes it possible
 to develop substantial applications in it.  The current version offers
 a module system, garbage collection and an interface to the C language.

Source package: t1utils
Package: t1utils
Description: A collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs.
 t1utils is a collection of simple type-1 font manipulation programs.
 Together, they allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.
 .
 This version of the t1utils programs has been maintained by Eddie
 Kohler <eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu> since version 1.5, based on the
 original code by I. Lee Hetherington.  As such, it is a complete
 replacement for the t1utils Debian package, which is based on version
 1.2 of I. Lee Hetherington's code.

Source package: tclcurl
Package: tclcurl
Description: Tcl interface to libcurl
 This module provides the same functionality as libcurl provides to

Source package: tclex
Package: tclex
Description: A lexical analyzer generator for Tcl
 tcLex is a lexer (lexical analyzer) generator extension to Tcl. It is
 inspired by Unix and GNU lex and flex, which are "tools for
 generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text". tcLex is
 very similar to these programs, except it uses Tcl philosophy and
 syntax, whereas the others use their own syntax and are used in
 conjunction with the C language. People used to lex or flex should
 then feel familiar with tcLex. tcLex is a small extension (the
 Windows compiled version is about 20kb, and the source is about
 150kb), because it extensively uses the Tcl library. However, the
 current doesn't use Tcl's regexp code anymore but a patched version
 is now included in tcLex, which makes it slightly bigger (by a few
 KB). tcLex should work with Tcl 8.0 and later.  tcLex will NEVER work
 with earlier versions, because it uses Tcl 8.0's "object" system for
 performance. The most interesting features are:
 .
  * cross-platform support, thanks to Tcl. Though it has been
    developped on Windows and tested on Windows and Unix only, it
    should work on other platforms as long as Tcl exists on these
    platforms. Supported Tcl platforms are Windows 95/NT, Unix (Linux,
    Solaris...) and Macintosh. Other platforms are VMS, OS/2,
    NeXTStep, Amiga...
 .
  * unlike lex and flex, which only generate static lexers written in
    C and intended to be compiled, tcLex dynamically generates Tcl
    commands that can be used like other C commands or Tcl procedures
    from within Tcl scripts or C programs.
 .
  * it uses Tcl regular expressions. That means you don't have to
    learn another regexp language.
 .
  * it works with Tcl namespaces
 .
  * the generated lexer commands can be used in one pass or
    incrementally, because they maintain state information. That way,
    several instances of the same lexer (eg a HTML parser) can run at
    the same time in distinct call frames and maintain distinct states
    (local variables...). Lexer need not be specially designed in
    order to be used incrementally, the same lexer can transparently
    be used in one pass or incrementally. This feature is especially
    useful when processing text from a file or an Internet socket (Web
    pages for example), when data is not necessarily available at the
    beginning of the processing.

Source package: tcpdump
Package: tcpdump
Description: A powerful tool for network monitoring and data acquisition
 This program allows you to dump the traffic on a network. tcpdump
 is able to examine IPv4, ICMPv4, IPv6, ICMPv6, UDP, TCP, SNMP, AFS
 BGP, RIP, PIM, DVMRP, IGMP, SMB, OSPF, NFS and many other packet
 types.
 .
 It can be used to print out the headers of packets on a network
 interface, filter packets that match a certain expression. You can
 use this tool to track down network problems, to detect "ping attacks"
 or to monitor network activities. More information is at
 <URL: http://www.tcpdump.org/>



Source package: tcpflow
Package: tcpflow
Description: TCP flow recorder
 tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
 connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient
 for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
 summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the
 data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow
 reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a
 separate file for later analysis.
 .
 tcpflow understands sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct
 data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.
 However, it currently does not understand IP fragments; flows
 containing IP fragments will not be recorded properly.
 .
 tcpflow is based on the LBL Packet Capture Library and therefore
 supports the same rich filtering expressions that programs like
 'tcpdump' support. tcpflow can also rebuild flows from data captured
 with 'tcpdump -w'.



Source package: tcpquota
Package: tcpquota
Description: A dialout/masquerading monitoring package.
 TCPQuota  monitors and debit users depending on there
 online time  (dialout). The program is made for those
 who  have a  local network  with  a server  that also
 functions as a Internet gateway (among other things).
 .
 The  server  runs diald,  for example, which does the
 actual  dial-on-demand,  and this package which debit
 each  user,   whether  from  the   server  or  from  a
 masqueraded host  (program includes masquerade code).
 .
 All a user from  inside the  gateway/firewall have to
 do  is run  the command 'openhost',  and the hostname
 and username  is masqueraded  and debited according to
 the time they spend calling out.



Source package: tcpreplay
Package: tcpreplay
Description: Tool to replay saved tcpdump files at arbitrary speeds
 Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by
 replaying real background network traffic in which to hide
 attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the
 traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike
 programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn't
 exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs,
 and doesn't reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on
 production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls,
 fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact
 replication of real traffic seen on real networks.



Source package: tcpslice
Package: tcpslice

Source package: tcpspy
Package: tcpspy
Description: Incoming and Outgoing TCP/IP connections logger.
 tcpspy is an administrator's tool that logs information
 about incoming and outgoing TCP/IP connections. It's
 written in C and uses no libpcap functions, unlike tcpdump.
 .
 Connections are selected for logging with rules, similarly
 to the filter expressions accepted by tcpdump. The
 following information is logged: username, local address
 and port, remote address and port, and, optionally, the
 executable filename.
 .
 At present, only the IPv4 protocol is supported.



Source package: tcpstat
Package: tcpstat
Description: network interface statistics reporting tool
 tcpstat reports certain network interface statistics much like vmstat
 does for system statistics. tcpstat gets its information by either
 monitoring a specific interface, or by reading previously saved tcpdump
 data from a file.



Source package: tcptraceroute
Package: tcptraceroute
Description: A traceroute implementation using TCP packets
 The more traditional traceroute(8) sends out either UDP or ICMP ECHO
 packets with a TTL of one, and increments the TTL until the destination
 has been reached. By printing the gateways that generate ICMP time
 exceeded messages along the way, it is able to determine the path packets
 are taking to reach the destination.
 .
 The problem is that with the widespread use of firewalls on the modern
 Internet, many of the packets that traceroute(8) sends out end up being
 filtered, making it impossible to completely trace the path to the
 destination.  However, in many cases, these firewalls will permit inbound
 TCP packets to specific ports that hosts sitting behind the firewall are
 listening for connections on. By sending out TCP SYN packets instead of
 UDP or ICMP ECHO packets, tcptraceroute is able to bypass the most common
 firewall filters.



Source package: tcputils

Source package: termcap-compat
Package: termcap-compat
Description: Compatibility package for old termcap-based programs.
 The termcap-compat package provides the libtermcap.so.2 and /etc/termcap
 files which are required to run non-Debian, binary-only termcap-based
 programs. Since libc6-based programs are hopefully "modern" enough to be
 linked with ncurses (or slang), this package only provides a libc5-based
 libtermcap library.
 .
 You do not need to install this package to run Debian-packaged programs
 since Debian GNU/Linux uses terminfo and not termcap. You need this
 package if a program (that you cannot recompile) fails to run with
 the error message "...: can't load library 'libtermcap.so.2'" or complains
 about a missing /etc/termcap file.
 .
 The termcap-compat package isn't meant to be used to compile programs
 therefore it doesn't provide all the necessary files for compilation. If you
 want to compile a program that claims to need termcap, why not try
 ncurses's termcap emulation instead? It's as simple as linking with ncurses
 instead of libtermcap (i.e. replace the '-ltermcap' with '-lncurses' in
 the makefile). Ncurses' termcap emulation routines translate terminfo entries
 to termcap entries on the fly, so you don't even need an /etc/termcap file.
 .
 This package provides:
  libtermcap.so shared library, version 2.0.8
  termcap database, version 10.2.7



Source package: terraform
Package: terraform
Description: A height field manipulation program

Source package: trustees
Package: trustees
Description: Advanced permission management system for Linux.
 The main goal of Linux trustees project is to create an advanced permission
 management system for linux. In fact, UNIX permission system is not suitable
 for solution of very common tasks.
 .
 E.g., let a system administrator wants to create a directory that available
 for some groups in write mode, for another groups - in read only. The files
 in the directory and subdirectories should inherits the parent's behavior,
 unless other is stated explicitly. Using standard UNIX (and Linux) security
 model it is generally speaking impossible to implement the situation when
 different groups have read/write and read/only permissions. This issue can be
 resolved by ext2-fs ACL project, but the problem is that nobody wants to copy
 mask or ACLs from parent directory to subdirectories either by hands or using
 special scripts.
 .
 Using the trustees, you can resolve this problems just typing
 [/device]/path:+group1:REBX
 .
 The solution proposed is mainly inspired by Novell Netware approach and Java
 security API.
 .
 Special objects (called trustees) can be bounded to every file or directory.
 Trustee object means that access to file or directory or directory with
 subdirectories is granted (or denied) to certain user or group (or all except
 user or group).
 .
 This package provides settrustee utility, which enables new privileges from

Source package: ucf
Package: ucf
Description: Update Configuration File - preserve user changes in config files
 Debian policy states that configuration files must preserve user
 changes during package upgrade. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a `conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it.  This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files that
 can not be labelled conffiles, are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead.  This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for "conffiles".
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided conffile like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 install time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Source package: vmnet
Package: vmnet
Description: A simple virtual networking program
 This program has been written to implement virtual networking
 support for the Hercules S/390 simulator, but it is intentionally
 generic in its functionality, so any other virtual machine
 simulator/emulator program could potentially use it.
 .
 The function is quite simple:
  - The virtual machine simulator program starts VMnet and talks
    the SLIP protocol with it over stdin/out.
  - VMnet sets up a SLIP connection on the host system, talking over a
    pseudo-tty to the VMnet program.
  - Once things have been set up, VMnet simply copies the data streams
    between stdin/out and the SLIP psuedo-tty in both directions.
 Thus, the virtual machine has a direct SLIP connection with the host,
 without needing to worry about root privileges, pseudo-ttys, access
 rights, etc.

Source package: vrfy
Package: vrfy
Description: Verify electronic mail addresses.
 'vrfy' is a tool to verify e-mail addresses and mailing lists.  In its
 simplest form it takes an address "user@domain", figures out the MX hosts
 for "domain", and issues the SMTP command VRFY at the primary MX host
 (optionally all), or at "domain" itself if no MX hosts exist.  Without
 "domain" it goes to "localhost".
 .
 More complex capabilities are:
  * recursively expanding forward files or mailing lists,
  * detecting mail forwarding loops,
  * understanding full-blown RFC822 address specifications,
  * syntax checking that can be carried out either locally or remotely,
  * various options provided to exploit alternative protocol suites
    if necessary, and to print many forms of verbose output.
 .
 Obvious limitations exist (mostly due to a lousy VRFY command
 implementation on some hosts), but otherwise, it works pretty well.

Source package: wget
Package: wget
Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web
 using http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as ftp
 sites-- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrive a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp
 retrievals can be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.



Source package: whereami
Package: whereami
Description: Automatically reconfigure your (laptop) system for a new location
 whereami is a set of useful scripts and a coordinating system for
 automatically re-locating your computer within the current (network)
 environment.
 .
 Typically, you would use whereami to automatically detect and
 re-configure your laptop when you move between a variety of diverse
 networks and/or docking environments.
 .
 Although whereami will work best if all of your networks assign
 addresses through dhcp, this is not a pre-requisite and the system
 allows any technique to be used to ascertain the new location with
 as little ongoing user intervention as possible.
 .
 Having ascertained the correct location, whereami will run appropriate
 (user-configured) scripts to adjust the laptop operation to suit the
 current environment.
 .
 See http://debiana.net/whereami/ for more information.  You may also
 get useful assistance from the debian-laptop mailing list, which is
 frequented by several of the contributors.

Source package: wn
Package: wn
Description: Secure and efficient http server with advanced features.
 WN is a server for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1).  Its
 primary design goals are security and functionality usually
 available only with complex CGI scripts without the necessity of
 writing or using these scripts.  This includes extensive
 security checks, full text searching and conditionally served
 text.
 .
 Despite this extensive functionality the WN executable is
 substantially smaller than the CERN or NCSA servers.  Both a
 stand-alone daemon and a version intended for use under inetd
 are provided.  The inetd version is designed to minimize the use
 of system resources and it is appropriate for moderate or
 lightly loaded servers which cannot be totally dedicated to Web
 serving.
 .
 WN's security model is based on the use of a small flat database
 in each directory with information about the files in that
 directory.  Fields associated with a file include its title, and
 may include keywords, expiration date and any user defined
 fields like author or document id.  Unlike other servers, the
 default action for WN is to deny access to a file.  A file can
 only be served if explicit permission to do so has been granted
 by entering it in this database.

Package: x10
Description: Operate X-10 electrical power control modules.
 X-10 modules are devices that plug into an electrical outlet
 and allow you to remotely control the power to a lamp or an appliance that
 is plugged into them. There are also X-10 modules that install in place of
 wall switches to control lights, and there's one that can be used to set
 back a thermostat.
 .
 This program commands up to 256 X-10 modules via a
 CP-290 serial-interface controller plugged into any serial port of your
 system. You can use it to automate your home!
 It's also commonly used to provide control over computers and other devices
 that might need to be powered up or down via a timed command or remote
 control. The CP-290 controller stores 128 clock-driven events that it will
 execute when your computer is turned off, so you can even program your
 computer to turn itself on at a particular time.
 .

Description: A dual-screen hack - link a MS-Windows and X display
 This program merges the capabilities of x2x and vncviewer.  It will allow a
 machine with an X display and a machine with a VNC server running on it's main
 screen to act as if they were two displays connected to one machine. When you
 move your mouse pointer off the screen in a direction of your choosing, the
 pointer will appear on the other screen instead.



Source package: x2x
Package: x2x
Description: Link two X displays together, simulating a multiheaded display
 x2x joins a pair of X displays together, as if they were a single
 multiheaded display.  The pointer can be warped between displays,
 or, depending on how you start x2x, can slide from one display to the
 other when it runs off the edge of the screen.  Keyboard focus also
 moves between displays in the way you'd expect, and the X selection
 propagates around.  At least one of the displays involved (specifically,
 the one being controlled remotely) must support the XTEST extension.
 (The servers shipped by Debian support this.)
 .
 x2x is useful when you have two displays on the same desk, as you can use
 a single keyboard and mouse to control both.  If you want to propagate
 your selections between displays which are not sharing a desk, you might
 be more interested in the package propsel.  Propsel does not link the
 displays' keyboard and mouse, which would be confusing in some cases,
 and can propagate between up to 8 displays, whereas x2x can handle only
 two at a time.

Source package: xfaces
Package: xfaces
Description: Displays an image for each piece of mail in your mailbox.
 XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
 piece of mail in your mail box. This lets you know at a
 glance who you have mail from. XFaces starts out (when you
 have no mail) looking like a color xbiff. As you receive
 mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images. Some of XFaces
 features:
 .
 - Both mono and color images.
 .
 - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.
 .
 - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server
 currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
 SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.
 .
 - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
 show up once on your display. This way, if you receive 30 messages
 from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.
 .
 - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
 images and sounds or ignore that mail message completely. This
 lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
 mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
 left in your system mailbox.
 .
 - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This
 includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
 list.
 .
 - Support for POP mailboxes.
 .
 - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
 contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priority
 item needs your attention.
 .
 - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
 so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
 be used.
 .
 - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
 count, user@host, the contents of any header.

Package: xdm
Description: X display manager
 xdm manages a collection of X servers, which may be on the local host or
 remote machines.  It provides services similar to those provided by init,
 getty, and login on character-based terminals: prompting for login name and
 password, authenticating the user, and running a session.  xdm supports XDMCP
 (X Display Manager Control Protocol) and can also be used to run a chooser
 process which presents the user with a menu of possible hosts that offer
 XDMCP display management.
 .
 If the xutils package is installed, xdm can use the sessreg utility to
 register login sessions to the system utmp file; this, however, is not
 necessary for xdm to function.
Package: xfonts-100dpi
Description: 100 dpi fonts for X
 xfonts-100dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 100 dots per inch.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains only fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-100dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-75dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-100dpi may be more suitable for large monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories for
 use by an X server or X font server.
Package: xfonts-100dpi-transcoded
Description: 100 dpi fonts for X (transcoded from ISO 10646-1)
 xfonts-100dpi-transcoded provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 100 dots per
 inch.  In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs)
 and/or an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains fonts in several ISO 8859 encodings: -2, -3, -4, -9,
 -10, -13, -14, and -15.  For the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1 encodings, see
 the xfonts-100dpi package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-75dpi-transcoded provide the same set of fonts,
 rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but
 both may be installed.  xfonts-100dpi-transcoded may be more suitable for

 encodings, to conserve disk space.  For other encodings, see the
 xfonts-75dpi-transcoded package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or small
 screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.
Package: xfonts-75dpi-transcoded
Description: 75 dpi fonts for X (transcoded from ISO 10646-1)
 xfonts-75dpi-transcoded provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per
 inch.  In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs)
 and/or an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains fonts in several ISO 8859 encodings: -2, -3, -4, -9,
 -10, -13, -14, and -15.  For the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1 encodings, see

 rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but
 both may be installed.  xfonts-75dpi-transcoded may be more suitable for
 small monitors and/or small screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.
Package: xfonts-base
Description: standard fonts for X
 xfonts-base provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped fonts.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains primarily fonts in the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1
 encodings, to conserve disk space.  (A small selection of fonts in ISO
 8859-8, JIS-X0208.1983, JIS-X0208.1976, and GB2312.1980 fonts are also
 included.)  For other encodings, see the xfonts-base-transcoded package.
 .
 If you are not using a remote font server, you must install this package if
 you are installing an X server.  It contains fonts without which X servers
 will not work.
 .
 This package also provides a set of files that can be used by the X or
 fonts server to transcode fonts from one encoding to another (e.g., KOI8-R
 to ISO-8859-5).
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.
Package: xfonts-base-transcoded
Description: standard fonts for X (transcoded from ISO 10646-1)
 xfonts-base-transcoded provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped
 fonts.  In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs)
 and/or an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains fonts in several ISO 8859 encodings (-2, -3, -4, -5,
 -7, -8, -9, -10, -13, -14, and -15) as well as KOI8-R.  For the ISO
 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1 encodings, see the xfonts-base package.
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.
Package: xfonts-cyrillic
Description: Cyrillic fonts for X
 xfonts-cyrillic provides a set of fonts using the Cyrillic alphabet for X
 servers.  In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs)
 and/or an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.
Package: xfonts-pex
Description: fonts for minimal PEX support in X
 The X server PEX extension, provided in the xext package, searches for
 these fonts by default, and outputs an error message if it can't find
 them.  Installing this package will suppress these messages.
Package: xfonts-scalable
Description: scalable fonts for X
 xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server
 or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to
 have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
 .
 This package is missing three fonts from the XFree86 source archives
 because the license terms on the fonts do not meet the Debian Free
 Software Guidelines; they are the Type1 fonts Adobe Utopia, IBM Courier,
 and Bigelow & Holmes (B&H) Lucidux.
 .
 This package requires the xutils package to prepare the font directories
 for use by an X server or X font server.
Package: xfree86-common
Description: X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure
 xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package (most
 likely xserver-xfree86).
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlibs package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 A recommended minimal list of packages for such a configuration is:
 xbase-clients, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-base, xfonts-scalable,
 xlibs, xserver-common, xutils, an X server (usually xserver-xfree86, but some
 users may require a different one), a window manager (several are available,
 and which you use is largely a matter of preference), and a terminal emulator
 X client package (again, several are available and which you use is your
 decision).
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.4".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is
 thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted terms
 are functionally interchangeable in a Debian system.
 .
 Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in
 /usr/share/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.
Package: xfs
Description: X font server
 xfs is a daemon that listens on a network port and serves X fonts to X
 servers (and thus to X clients).  All X servers have the ability to serve
 locally installed fonts for themselves, but xfs makes it possible to offload
 that job from the X server, and/or have a central repository of fonts on a
 networked machine running xfs so that all the machines running X servers on a
 network do not require their own set of fonts.  xfs may also be invoked by
 users to, for instance, make available X fonts in user accounts that are not
 available to the X server or to an already running system xfs.
Package: xfwp
Description: X firewall proxy server
 The X firewall proxy is an application layer gateway proxy that may be run
 on a network firewall host to forward X traffic across the firewall.  Used
 in conjunction with the X server Security extension and authorization
 checking, xfwp constitutes a safe, simple, and reliable mechanism both to
 hide the addresses of X servers located on an intranet and to enforce a
 server connection policy.  Xfwp cannot protect against mischief
 originating on an intranet; however, when properly configured it can
 guarantee that only trusted clients originating on authorized external
 Internet hosts will be allowed inbound access to local X servers.
Package: xlib6g
Description: pseudopackage providing X libraries
 This package smooths the migration from Debian 2.2 by depending on xlibs and
 libxaw6.  This pseudopackage is only depended upon by packages that haven't
 yet been compiled against the newer X library packages.
 .
 This package also conflicts with packages that are no longer supported in
 Debian and do not comply with the Debian app-defaults policy.  (In some
 cases, the functionality of these old packages has been absorbed into other
 packages in Debian 3.0 ("woody").)
Package: xlib6g-dev
Description: pseudopackage providing X library development files
 This package smooths the migration from Debian 2.2 by depending on xlibs-dev,
 libxaw-dev, and xutils.  This pseudopackage is only depended upon by packages
 that haven't yet corrected their dependencies to reflect the new library
 arrangement.
Package: xlibmesa-dev
Description: XFree86 version of Mesa 3D graphics library development files
 xlibmesa-dev provides static versions of the libraries provided in xlibmesa3,
 as well as header files and manual pages.
Package: xlibmesa3
Description: XFree86 version of Mesa 3D graphics library
 Mesa is a 3D graphics library which presents an API intended to be compatible
 with OpenGL.  XFree86 maintains its own version of the Mesa library (which is
 regularly resynchronized with the official one) to permit development of the
 XFree86 X server's Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), which makes the 3D
 acceleration features of many modern video cards available to X client
 programmers.
 .
 Chipset-specific DRI modules, if available for your machine architecture,
 are provided in this package.  (Unlike the modules in the xserver-xfree86
 package, the DRI modules are loaded by the Mesa library, not by the X server
 itself.)
Package: xlibmesa3-dbg
Description: XFree86 version of Mesa 3D graphics library (unstripped)
 This package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a
 debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding
 logic errors in programs using this library (or the library itself).  The
 library is installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that
 directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to
 be debugged is executed.
 .
 Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.  See the
 xlibmesa3 package for further information.
Package: xlibosmesa-dev
Description: Mesa/XFree86 off-screen rendering library development files
 xlibosmesa-dev provides static versions of the libraries provided in
 xlibosmesa3, as well as header files and manual pages.
Package: xlibosmesa3
Description: Mesa/XFree86 off-screen rendering library
 Mesa is a 3D graphics library which presents an API intended to be compatible
 with OpenGL.  XFree86 maintains its own version of the Mesa library (which is
 regularly resynchronized with the official one) to permit development of the
 XFree86 X server's Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), which makes the 3D
 acceleration features of many modern video cards available to X client
 programmers.
 .
 The off-screen rendering library (OSMesa) is an extension to Mesa, not an
 implementation of any OpenGL standard; therefore, it is packaged separately,
 so that any OpenGL-conformant library may be installed on a Debian system,
 and OpenGL-based programs may depend on any of them.  The OSMesa library,
 however, specifically depends on the Mesa library.
Package: xlibosmesa3-dbg
Description: Mesa/XFree86 off-screen rendering library (unstripped)
 This package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a
 debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding
 logic errors in programs using this library (or the library itself).  The
 library is installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that
 directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable when the code to
 be debugged is executed.
 .
 Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.  See the
 xlibosmesa3 package for further information.
Package: xlibs
Description: X Window System client libraries
 The X libraries are an interface between X client programs and the
 hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the
 keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is
 independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X
 libraries, and the programs that use them, communicate with X servers by
 means of the X protocol.
 .
 libX11 (a.k.a. Xlib) provides the low-level functionality, dealing mostly
 with the wire protocol and in terms of basic operations such as opening and
 closing the X protocol connection, creating graphics contexts, drawing
 graphics primitives such as lines, arcs, and glyphs, handling events, and so
 forth.
 .
 libXpm, the X pixmap library, is a set of routines used to store and retrieve
 X pixmaps (a data structure comprising a rectangular array of pixels) from
 files; the xpm file format is an extension of the monochrome bitmap file
 format in the X11 specification.  (Traditionally, libXpm was maintained and
 distributed separately from the X Window System, but XFree86 has absorbed
 this library).
 .
 libXt, the X Toolkit Intrinsics, is an abstract widget library upon which
 graphical widget libraries (such as Athena and LessTif) may be developed; the
 Intrinsics provide a number of useful interfaces to X conventions and
 protocols, in many cases reducing a long series of Xlib calls to just a
 couple of Xt calls.
 .
 libXmu is a set of miscellaneous utility functions useful to client
 programmers.
 .
 libXmuu is a very small set of miscellaneous utility functions extracted
 from Xmu, Xt, and Xaw, for clients that need the occasional useful
 function from these libraries but do not require the toolkit overhead.  To
 use libXmuu, simply include the headers for the other libraries in the
 client and link against Xmuu instead of Xmu, Xt, and Xaw.  Needless to
 say, if the client uses functions from Xmu, Xt, or Xaw that are not
 present in Xmuu, it will fail to link.
 .
 The remainder of the libraries in this package implement the client side
 of various X protocol extensions:
  - libICE, the Inter-Client Exchange extension;
  - libPEX5, PEX, a 3D graphics extension now superseded by Mesa/OpenGL;
  - libSM, the Session Management extension;
  - libXIE, the X Image Extension;
  - libXext, a collection of several commonly-used extensions;
  - libXft, a FreeType-based font rendering extension;
  - libXi, the X Input extension;
  - libXp, the X Printing extension; and
  - libXrender, an extension for digital image composition;
  - libXtst, the X Testing extension.
 .
 xlibs also contains the XKB keyboard parameter files, locale data, and a set
 of bitmap and pixmap image files commonly used by X clients.
Package: xlibs-dbg
Description: X Window System client libraries (unstripped)
 This package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a
 debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding
 logic errors in programs using the libraries in this package (or the
 libraries themselves).  The library is installed in /usr/X11R6/lib/debug
 and can be used by placing that directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 environment variable when the code to be debugged is executed.
 .
 Non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.  See the xlibs
 package for more information.
Package: xlibs-dev
Description: X Window System client library development files
 xlibs-dev provides static versions of the libraries provided in xlibs, as
 well as several libraries that do not exist in shared object form for
 various reasons (such as the fact that their APIs have not stabilized, or
 that they are deprecated).  Header files and manual pages are also
 provided.
 .
 The libraries available only in static form include:
  - libFS
  - libXau
  - libXdmcp
  - libXfont
  - libXfontcache
  - libXinerama
  - libXss
  - libXv
  - libXxf86dga
  - libXxf86misc
  - libXxf86rush
  - libXxf86vm
  - libfntstubs
  - liboldX
  - libxf86config
  - libxkbfile
  - libxkbui
Package: xlibs-pic
Description: X Window System client extension library PIC archives
 xlibs-pic provides PIC archives (static libraries with PIC information) of
 some of the libraries in xlibs-dev that are available in xlibs-dev as static
 objects.
 .
 These archives are available for use *only* for linking into objects which
 will be accessed using the dlopen() function, such as plugin modules for
 applications.
 .
 The libraries available in PIC archive form include:
  - libXv
  - libXxf86dga
  - libXxf86vm
Package: xmh
Description: X interface to the MH mail system
 xmh provides a graphical user interface to the MH (Message Handler) mail
 system.  xmh is a very old X client and is not exactly a "living" piece of
 software.  MH users will probably prefer the exmh package, which serves the
 same function and continues to be actively developed.
Package: xnest
Description: nested X server
 xnest an X server that is itself an X client.  This allows you to run a
 server within a server; this is occasionally useful for testing new window
 managers and other X clients.
 .
 Xnest relies upon its parent X server for font services.
Package: xprt
Description: X print server
 xprt provides an X server with the print extension and special DDX
 (Device-Dependent X) implementation.
Package: xserver-common
Description: files and utilities common to all X servers
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is to
 communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a
 standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such
 things as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many
 buttons the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself
 know the technical specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the
 keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know of a
 remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The former
 means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font packages
 may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least the
 xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages.
Package: xserver-xfree86
Description: the XFree86 X server
 The XFree86 X server is an X server for several architectures and operating
 systems; its architecture was completely redesigned for the 4.0 release, and
 features a loadable module system in which required modules are loaded on
 demand by a single server binary as opposed to the video card-specific X
 servers of the 3.x release.
 .
 The XFree86 server supports most modern graphics hardware from most vendors,
 and supersedes most version 3.x XFree86 X servers.  See
 <http://www.xfree86.org/4.1.0/Status.html> for information on its support for
 your particular hardware.
 .
 If the mdetect and read-edid packages are present, the debconf scripts in
 this package will use them to attempt automatic configuration of your mouse
 and monitor.
 .
 Note that on the hppa architecture, the server's loadable module support
 is not present, and therefore the XFree86 server is a (very large) single
 binary.
Package: xspecs
Description: X protocol, extension, and library technical specifications
 A comprehensive collection of manuals (most in both PostScript and text
 format, but some in text format only) documenting the standard specifications

Package: xterm
Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
Package: xutils
Description: X Window System utility programs
 xutils provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window System
 that do not require the X libraries; many of these programs are useful
 even on a system that does not have any X clients or X servers installed.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - atobm, a converter from ASCII to X bitmap (.xbm) files;
  - bdftopcf, which converts BDF fonts to PCF fonts;
  - bdftruncate.pl and ucs2any.pl, tools to generate fonts with various
    encodings from ISO 10646-encoded fonts

 files, is necessary if the imake or xmkmf tools are to be used.
 .
 Installation of an rsh or ssh daemon (server) is necessary if rstartd is
 to be used, and installation of an rsh or ssh client is necessary if
 rstart is to be used.
Package: xvfb
Description: virtual framebuffer X server
 xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices.  It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.



Source package: xfree86-1
Package: rstart
Description: remote application start client
 rstart is an implementation of a remote application start client based on
 rsh.
Package: rstartd
Description: remote application start daemon
 rstartd is an implementation of a remote applications start daemon based on
 rsh.
Package: twm
Description: Tab window manager
 twm is a window manager for the X Window System.  It provides title bars,
 shaped windows, several forms of icon management, user-defined macro
 functions, click-to-type and pointer-driven keyboard focus, and
 user-specified key and pointer button bindings.
Package: xbase
Description: XFree86 upgrade convenience package
 Between Debian 2.0 ("hamm") and 2.1 ("slink") the XFree86 packages were
 extensively reorganized; this package exists solely to smooth the transition
 for people upgrading from Debian 2.0 or earlier.  Those whose have fresh
 installations of Debian 2.1 or later have no need of this package.
 .
 Once this package has been installed it may be removed at any time; it
 contains no programs, libraries, or documentation.
 .
 For the technically curious, this package exists solely to declare
 dependencies on the packages among whom the old xbase package's files were
 distributed.  The new packages are auto-selected by apt or dselect as a
 result, and the X Window System is properly upgraded.
 .
 Additionally, the X font and static library packages have been renamed.  For
 more information see the /usr/doc/xbase/README.Debian file in this package or
 /usr/doc/xfree86-common/README.Debian-upgrade in the xfree86-common package.
Package: xbase-clients
Description: miscellaneous X clients
 An X client is a program that uses the X libraries to interface with an X
 server, and thus with some input and output hardware like a graphics card,
 monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X clients that ship with
 the X Window System, including:
  * xinit and startx, the programs that start an X session on demand from the
    command line;
  * a bitmap editor and conversion utilities;
  * utilities for font display and format conversion;
  * beforelight, a rudimentary screensaver;
  * X resource display and editing utilities;
  * X server testing and performance evaluation programs;
  * graphical clocks (xclock and oclock);
  * X session access control programs;
  * tools for use with the XKEYBOARD (XKB) extension;
  * xmodmap, a tool for remapping keys and pointer buttons;
  * xvidtune, a video mode tuner for XFree86 X servers;
  * a screen/window capture program, xwd (and viewer for the captures, xwud);
 and several other programs of general utility in the X Window System.
 .
 xbase-clients depends on cpp because xrdb requires it; the conflicts,
 replaces, and provides are due to package reorganizations and to ensure
 up-to-date support mechanisms for xaw-wrappers and X font packages.
Package: xdm
Description: X display manager
 xdm manages a collection of X servers, which may be on the local host or
 remote machines.  It provides services similar to those provided by init,
 getty, and login on character-based terminals; prompting for login name and
 password, authenticating the user, and running a session.  xdm supports XDMCP
 (X Display Manager Control Protocol) and can also be used to run a chooser
 process which presents the user with a menu of possible hosts that offer
 XDMCP display management.
Package: xext
Description: extensions to X servers
 xext provides extensions to X servers.  This presently includes a system for
 3D rendering under X called PEX (the PHIGS/PHIGS-PLUS Extension to X, in
 which PHIGS stands for Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics
 System), XIE (X Image Extension), and XInput, which can manage the
 following input devices:
   * joystick (PC gameport type)
   * Elographics touchscreen
   * MicroTouch touchscreens (using stylus or finger)
   * mouse
   * Wacom eraser
   * Wacom cursor
   * SummaSketch tablet
   * AceCad tablet
   * CalComp DrawingBoard tablet
   * SWITCH virtual device
   * SGI button box
 .
 If you intend to use the joystick extension (and the joycal joystick
 calibration program), and are using a Linux kernel version prior to 2.2, you
 will need the joystick kernel module package.  The joystick extension is not
 available in the m68k version of this package.
Package: xf86setup
Description: X server configuration tools
 xf86setup contains two X clients used to configure XFree86 X servers.
 .
 XF86Setup itself is used to either perform the initial setup of the servers
 or to make adjustments to the existing configuration; when invoked from the
 console to initially configure the XFree86 servers, it will start the VGA16
 server and then allow configuration settings to be entered.  When run from
 within an already running server environment (e.g. from an xterm window),
 XF86Setup can be used to make adjustments to the current server
 configuration.
 .
 Again, if you wish to use the XF86Setup program to perform initial
 configuration of the X server (i.e., you do not have a working XF86Config
 file), you MUST have the xserver-vga16 package installed.
 .
 xf86setup also contains a graphical mouse configuration utility, xmseconfig.
 .
 Note to Alpha users: The XF86Setup program has no awareness of TGA
 hardware and cannot be used to configure the TGA server.  Because the VGA16
 server does not work on the Alpha, XF86Setup can only be used to adjust an
 existing X server configuration on that architecture.
Package: xfree86-common
Description: X Window System (XFree86) infrastructure
 xfree86-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package.
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlib6g package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 A recommended minimal list of packages for such a configuration is:
 xbase-clients, xf86setup, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-base,
 xfonts-scalable, xlib6g, xserver-common, an xserver (several are available,
 and which you use is largely dependent on your graphics hardware), a window
 manager (several are available, and which you use is largely a matter of
 preference), and a terminal emulator X client package (again, several are
 available and which you use is your decision).
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.3".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the XFree86 Project, Inc., and is
 thus often also referred to as "XFree86".  All of the preceding quoted terms
 are functionally interchangeable in a Debian system.
 .
 Still confused?  Install this package and then read the files in
 /usr/doc/xfree86-common/ for assistance.
Package: xfs
Description: X font server
 xfs is a daemon that listens on a network port and serves X fonts to X
 servers (and thus to X clients).  All X servers have the ability to serve
 locally installed fonts for themselves, but xfs makes it possible to offload
 that job from the X server, and/or have a central repository of fonts on a
 networked machine running xfs so that all the machines running X servers on a
 network do not require their own set of fonts.  xfs may also be invoked by
 users to, for instance, make available X fonts in user accounts that are not
 available to the X server or to an already running system xfs.
Package: xlib6
Description: shared libraries required by libc5 X clients
 The X libraries are the interface between X client programs and the
 hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the
 keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is
 independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X
 libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.  Xlib itself
 provides the low-level functionality; Xt, the X Toolkit Instrinsics, is often
 used as a foundation for widget libraries such as Lesstif or Athena.  Xaw,
 the Athena widget set, provides a rudimentary set of graphical user-interface
 elements (buttons, scrollbars, text boxes, etc.).  Several more libraries are
 provided to implement the functions of various X extensions.
 .
 X clients compiled against libc5 require that the X libraries be compiled
 against libc5 as well.  xlib6 provides such backward compatibility.
Package: xlib6-altdev
Description: include files and libraries for libc5 X client development
 xlib6-altdev provides the standard set of include files for X and some
 non-shared libraries (with debugging symbols) required for X client
 development.  You only need to install it if you intend to compile X clients
 against libc5 yourself.
 .
 This package only provides statically linked libraries that have no shared
 object version in xlib6.
 .
 This package does not include the manual pages for the functions in the X
 libraries; for those, install the xmanpages package.
Package: xlib6g
Description: shared libraries required by X clients
 The X libraries are the interface between X client programs and the
 hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the
 keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is
 independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X
 libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.  Xlib itself
 provides the low-level functionality; Xt, the X Toolkit Intrinsics, is often
 used as a foundation for widget libraries such as Lesstif or Athena.  Xaw,
 the Athena widget set, provides a rudimentary set of graphical user-interface
 elements (buttons, scrollbars, text boxes, etc.).  Several more libraries are
 provided to implement the functions of various X extensions.
 .
 xlib6g also contains the XKB specification files, locale data, and the bitmap
 image files that ship with X11R6.3.
Package: xlib6g-dev
Description: include files and libraries for X client development
 xlib6g-dev provides the standard set of include files for X, and some static
 libraries (with debugging symbols) required for X client development.  You
 only need to install it if you intend to compile X clients yourself.
 .
 This package only provides statically linked libraries that have no shared
 object version in xlib6g.  For statically linked versions of the libraries in
 the xlib6g package, see the xlib6g-static package.
 .
 This package does not include the manual pages for the functions in the X
 libraries; for those, install the xmanpages package.
Package: xlib6g-static
Description: statically linked versions of the libraries in xlib6g
 You only need to install this package if you intend to compile statically
 linked X clients.  Static libraries with no shared version are in the
 xlib6g-dev package.  The libraries in this package include debugging symbols.
Package: xmh
Description: X interface to MH mail system
 xmh provides a graphical user interface to the MH (Message Handler) mail
 system.  xmh is a very old X client and is not exactly a "living" piece of
 software.  MH users will probably prefer the exmh package, which serves the
 same function and continues to be actively developed.
Package: xnest
Description: nested X server
 xnest an X server that is itself an X client.  This allows you to run a
 server within a server; this is occasionally useful for testing new window
 managers and other X clients.
 .
 Xnest relies upon its parent X server for font services.
Package: xproxy
Description: X proxy services
 xproxy provides a low bandwidth X proxy (lbxproxy), an X firewall proxy
 (xfwp), and a proxy manager service (proxymngr).
 .
 lbxproxy is useful for running X clients across a slow network connection.
 Applications need not know anything about the Low Bandwidth extension to X
 (LBX); they simply connect to lbxproxy as if it were another server.  The
 proxy accepts client connections, multiplexes them over a single connection
 to the X server, and performs various optimizations on the X protocol to make
 it faster over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections.
 .
 xfwp is an application layer gateway proxy that may be run on a network
 firewall host to forward X traffic across the firewall.
 .
 proxymngr is responsible for resolving requests from xfindproxy (in the
 xbase-clients package) and other similar clients, starting new proxies when
 appropriate, and keeping track of all the available proxy services.
Package: xprt
Description: X print server
 xprt provides an X server with the print extension and special DDX
 (Device-Dependent X) implementation.
Package: xserver-3dlabs
Description: X server for 3DLabs GLINT and Permedia-based graphics cards
 xserver-3dlabs is an 8-bit PseudoColor, 16-bit TrueColor, 24-bit
 TrueColor, and 32-bit TrueColor X server suitable for use with some 3DLabs
 GLINT 500TX, GLINT MX, Permedia, and Permedia 2 graphic accelerator
 boards.  24-bit operation is supported only on the Permedia 2.
Package: xserver-8514
Description: X server for ATI 8514/A-based graphics cards
 xserver-8514 is an 8-bit PseudoColor X server suitable for use with ATI
 8514/A graphic accelerator boards.
Package: xserver-agx
Description: X server for IBM XGA and IIT AGX-based graphics cards
 xserver-agx is an 8-bit PseudoColor and 16-bit TrueColor X server suitable
 for use with IIT AGX or IBM XGA graphic accelerator boards.
Package: xserver-common
Description: files and utilities common to all X servers
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is to
 communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a
 standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such
 things as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many
 buttons the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself
 know the technical specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the
 keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 Most of the X servers in Debian are authored by the XFree86 Project, Inc.,
 which also distributes the rest of the X Window System source code for
 convenience.  XFree86's X servers attempt where possible to take advantage of
 acceleration features present within the video hardware.
 .
 xserver-common contains files required by all XFree86 X servers, and includes
 a text-based program (xf86config) that configures the /etc/X11/XF86Config
 file, whose primary purpose is to describe the computer's video and input
 hardware to the X server.
 .
 All X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know
 of a remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The
 former means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font
 packages may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least
 the xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages.
 .
 For a more sophisticated (and graphical) X server configuration tool, see
 the xf86setup package (currently for the i386 architecture only).
Package: xserver-fbdev
Description: X server for framebuffer-based graphics drivers
 xserver-fbdev is an X server that uses the kernel-based framebuffer device
 driver for display.
 .
 To use this server, you must have a kernel that supports the framebuffer
 console device.  For the Alpha and i386 architectures, this capability is
 absent from the 2.0 (and earlier) kernel series.  Users of these
 architectures must use version 2.2 or later of the Linux kernel with support
 for an appropriate framebuffer console driver to employ this X server.
Package: xserver-i128
Description: X server for Number Nine Imagine 128 graphics cards
 xserver-i128 is an X server suitable for use with Number Nine Imagine 128,
 Ticket 2 Ride, Revolution 3D, and Revolution IV graphics cards.

 xserver-mach64 is an 8-bit PseudoColor, 16-bit TrueColor, and 32-bit
 TrueColor X server suitable for use with ATI Mach64, 3D Rage, 3D Rage II, and
 3D Rage Pro accelerator boards.  16-bit and 32-bit operation is not supported
 on all accelerator boards.
Package: xserver-mach8
Description: X server for ATI Mach8-based graphics cards
 xserver-mach8 is an 8-bit PseudoColor X server suitable for use with ATI
 Mach8 graphic accelerator boards.
Package: xserver-mono
Description: X server for monochrome graphics cards and/or monitors
 xserver-mono is a monochrome X server suitable for use with most VGA and SVGA
 cards.  It also supports the Hercules monochrome card, the Hyundai HGC1280,
 Sigma LaserView, Visa and Apollo monochrome cards.

 xserver-s3 is an 8-bit PseudoColor, 16-bit TrueColor, and 32-bit TrueColor
 X server suitable for use with S3 graphic accelerator boards (with some
 exceptions, like the ViRGE and ViRGE/VX series).  16-bit and 32-bit operation
 is not supported on all accelerator boards.
Package: xserver-s3v
Description: X server for S3 ViRGE and ViRGE/VX-based graphics cards
 xserver-s3v is an 8-bit PseudoColor and 16-bit TrueColor X server suitable
 for use with S3 ViRGE and ViRGE/VX graphic accelerator boards. In most cases
 use of this X server is deprecated in favor of the SVGA X server.
Package: xserver-svga
Description: X server for SVGA graphics cards
 xserver-svga is an 8-bit PseudoColor, 16-bit TrueColor, and 24-bit TrueColor
 X server suitable for use with many Super VGA video cards; video chipsets
 supported include models from Ark Logic, Alliance, ATI, Avance Logic, Chips &
 Technologies, Cirrus Logic, Compaq, Cyrix, Epson, Genoa, Intel, Matrox, MX,
 NCR, NVidia(/SGS Thomson), NeoMagic, Oak, RealTek, Rendition, S3, SiS, Tseng,
 Video7(/Headland Technologies), and Western Digital(/Paradise).  16-bit and
 24-bit TrueColor are currently only supported for some chipsets.
 .
 Note to Intel i810 chipset users: full support of this graphics hardware is
 only possible with a specialized kernel module.  See
 /usr/doc/xserver-svga/README.Debian for more information.
 .
 Note to Alpha users: Only the Matrox, NVidia, S3 Virge, and Trident drivers
 are provided for this architecture.  This server also does not support TGA
 hardware.
Package: xserver-tga
Description: X server for Digital Equipment Corporation TGA graphics cards
 xserver-tga is an X server suitable for use with the Digital Equipment
 Corporation TGA (DEC 21030) graphics cards found in some Alphas.
Package: xserver-vga16
Description: X server for VGA graphics cards
 xserver-vga16 is a 16-color X server suitable for use with most
 VGA-compatible cards.  It also includes support for the non-VGA monochrome
 cards supported by the xserver-mono package.  For most people this X server
 is only useful to kick-start the XF86Setup program (in the xf86setup
 package).
 .
 Note to Alpha users: This server does not support TGA hardware.
Package: xserver-w32
Description: X server for Tseng ET4000/W32 and ET6000-based graphics cards
 xserver-w32 is an 8-bit PseudoColor X server suitable for use with Tseng
 ET4000/W32, ET4000/W32i, ET4000/W32p, and ET6000 graphics accelerator boards.
 For 16, 24 and 32 bit per pixel support on the ET6000, try the xserver-svga
 package.
Package: xserver-xsun
Description: X server for 8-bit Sun framebuffers
 xserver-xsun is an X server suitable for use with CG3, CG6, and other 8-bit
 framebuffers.  Monochrome framebuffer support is also compiled in.  Most Sun
 (and some Sun clone) 8-bit framebuffers are supported.
 .
 It should be noted that this X server does not come from XFree86; as such,
 the server is not built with support for the X protocol extensions
 XFree86-DGA, XFree86-Misc, and XFree86-VidModeExtension.  X clients that
 require these extensions will not work with this server.  It also does not
 use the /etc/X11/XF86Config file, and demands exclusive access to the mouse
 device (and thus cannot be used with the gpm package).
Package: xserver-xsun-mono
Description: X server for monochrome Sun framebuffers
 xserver-xsun-mono is an X server suitable for use with BWTWO (and other mono)
 framebuffers.  Just about any monochrome framebuffer you can find will
 probably work with this server, along with some color framebuffers operating
 in mono mode.
 .
 It should be noted that this X server does not come from XFree86; as such,
 the server is not built with support for the X protocol extensions
 XFree86-DGA, XFree86-Misc, and XFree86-VidModeExtension.  X clients that
 require these extensions will not work with this server.  It also does not
 use the /etc/X11/XF86Config file, and demands exclusive access to the mouse
 device (and thus cannot be used with the gpm package).
Package: xserver-xsun24
Description: X server for 24-bit Sun framebuffers
 xserver-xsun24 is an X server suitable for use with 24-bit color Sun
 framebuffers.  This server is still a bit experimental and may have a few
 minor problems.  Also, it supports a select few of the possible graphics
 cards (and not all of those are recognized by the kernel, making the list
 even shorter).  Assuming you have one of the few 24-bit framebuffers
 recognized by the Linux kernel, this server might be something to try.
 .
 It should be noted that this X server does not come from XFree86; as such,
 the server is not built with support for the X protocol extensions
 XFree86-DGA, XFree86-Misc, and XFree86-VidModeExtension.  X clients that
 require these extensions will not work with this server.  It also does not
 use the /etc/X11/XF86Config file, and demands exclusive access to the mouse
 device (and thus cannot be used with the gpm package).
Package: xsm
Description: X session manager
 A session is a group of applications, each of which has a particular state.
 xsm allows you to create arbitrary sessions -- for example, you might have a
 "light" session, a "development" session, or an "xterminal" session.  Each
 session can have its own set of applications.  Within a session, you can
 perform a "checkpoint" to save application state, or a "shutdown" to save
 state and exit the session.  When you log back in to the system, you can load
 a specific session, and you can delete sessions you no longer want to keep.
 .
 Many window managers and desktop environments for X also provide session
 management services; this is the original X Consortium reference
 implementation.
Package: xterm
Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
Package: xvfb
Description: virtual framebuffer X server
 xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices.  It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package should not be confused with xserver-fbdev, the X server that
 interfaces with the kernel's framebuffer device; this package, xvfb, does not
 use the video hardware and is not a "real" X server in the popular sense.



Source package: xfree86-2
Package: xfonts-100dpi
Description: 100 dpi fonts for X
 xfonts-100dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 100 dots per inch.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-75dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-100dpi may be more suitable for large monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).
Package: xfonts-75dpi
Description: 75 dpi fonts for X
 xfonts-75dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 75 dots per inch.  In most
 cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-100dpi provide the same set of fonts, rendered at
 different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but both may be
 installed.  xfonts-75dpi may be more suitable for small monitors and/or small
 screen resolutions (under 1024x768).
Package: xfonts-base
Description: standard fonts for X
 xfonts-base provides a standard set of low-resolution bitmapped fonts.  In
 most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 If you are not using a remote font server, you must install this package if
 you are installing an X server.  It contains fonts without which X servers
 will not work.
Package: xfonts-cjk
Description: basic Chinese, Japanese, and Korean fonts for X
 xfonts-cjk provides fonts suitable for displaying text in the Chinese,
 Japanese, and Korean languages.  In most cases it is desirable to have the X
 font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts available to
 X clients.
Package: xfonts-cyrillic
Description: Cyrillic fonts for X
 xfonts-cyrillic provides a set of fonts using the Cyrillic alphabet for X
 servers.  In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs)
 and/or an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
Package: xfonts-pex
Description: fonts for minimal PEX support in X
 The X server PEX extension, provided in the xext package, searches for
 these fonts by default, and outputs an error message if it can't find
 them.  Installing this package will suppress these messages.
Package: xfonts-scalable
Description: scalable fonts for X
 xfonts-scalable provides fonts that can be drawn at any size by the X server
 or font server without loss of quality.  In most cases it is desirable to
 have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
Package: xmanpages
Description: manual pages for X client developers
 The manual pages provided in this package document the programmers' interface
 to the functions provided by the X libraries.  They do not document the
 standard X clients or the servers; those manpages are included in the
 appropriate package (e.g., xdm's manpage is in the xdm package).
 .
 X client or server developers will likely also find the xbooks package of
 utility.

Description: extensions to XFree86 3.x servers
 xext provides extensions to XFree86 version 3.x servers.  This presently
 includes a system for 3D rendering under X called PEX (the PHIGS/PHIGS-PLUS
 Extension to X, in which PHIGS stands for Programmer's Hierarchical
 Interactive Graphics System), XIE (X Image Extension), and XInput, which can
 manage the following input devices:
   * joystick (PC game port type)
   * Elographics touch screen
   * MicroTouch touch screens (using stylus or finger)
   * mouse
   * Wacom eraser
   * Wacom cursor
   * SummaSketch tablet
   * AceCad tablet
   * CalComp DrawingBoard tablet
   * SWITCH virtual device
   * SGI button box
 .
 While this package is installable without an X server on the system, it is
 only useful in conjunction with an XFree86 3.x X server.  Note that the
 loadable extension modules in this package are not compatible with, and are
 not used by, the XFree86 version 4.x X server.
 .
 If you intend to use the joystick extension (and the joycal joystick
 calibration program), and are using a Linux kernel version prior to 2.2, you
 will need the joystick kernel module package.
 .
 Note that the PEX extension is not supported on the Alpha architecture.
Package: xlib6
Description: shared libraries required by libc5 X clients
 The X libraries are the interface between X client programs and the
 hardware-oriented X servers, and consist of routines to read input from the
 keyboard and pointer, draw on the screen, etc., in an abstract manner that is
 independent of the particular characteristics of the hardware.  The X
 libraries communicate with X servers by means of the X protocol.  Xlib itself
 provides the low-level functionality; Xt, the X Toolkit Intrinsics, is often
 used as a foundation for widget libraries such as Lesstif or Athena.  Xaw,
 the Athena widget set, provides a rudimentary set of graphical user-interface
 elements (buttons, scrollbars, text boxes, etc.).  Several more libraries are
 provided to implement the functions of various X extensions.
 .
 X clients compiled against libc5 require that the X libraries be compiled
 against libc5 as well.  xlib6 provides such backward compatibility.
 .
 To avoid redundancy, this package depends on the current version of the X
 library packages for various non-binary files used by the X libraries
 (bitmaps, locale data, etc.).
Package: xlib6-altdev
Description: include files and libraries for libc5 X client development
 xlib6-altdev provides the standard set of include files for X and some
 non-shared libraries (with debugging symbols) required for X client
 development.  You only need to install it if you intend to compile X clients
 against libc5 yourself.
 .
 This package does not include the manual pages for the functions in the X
 libraries; modern X client development should be done with the X libraries
 available in the xlibs and xlibs-dev packages.
Package: xserver-3dlabs

 8514/A graphic accelerator boards.
Package: xserver-agx
Description: X server for IBM XGA and IIT AGX-based graphics cards
 xserver-agx is an 8-bit PseudoColor and 16-bit TrueColor X server suitable
 for use with IIT AGX or IBM XGA graphic accelerator boards.
Package: xserver-common-v3
Description: files and utilities common to XFree86 3.x X servers
 The new XFree86 version 4.x X server, available in the xserver-xfree86
 packages, does not support some of the graphics hardware (mostly older
 equipment) that the version 3.x servers do.  Odds are that your video
 hardware is supported by XFree86 4.x, and you do not need an old 3.x server.
 .
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is to
 communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a
 standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such
 things as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many
 buttons the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself
 know the technical specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the
 keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 Most of the X servers in Debian are authored by the XFree86 Project, Inc.,
 which also distributes the rest of the X Window System source code for
 convenience.  XFree86's X servers attempt where possible to take advantage of
 acceleration features present within the video hardware.
 .
 xserver-common-v3 contains files required by XFree86 version 3.x X servers, and
 includes a text-based program (xf86config-v3) that configures the
 /etc/X11/XF86Config file, whose primary purpose is to describe the computer's
 video and input hardware to the X server.
 .
 All X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know
 of a remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The
 former means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font
 packages may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least
 the xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages.
Package: xserver-fbdev
Description: X server for framebuffer-based graphics drivers
 xserver-fbdev is an X server that uses the kernel-based framebuffer device
 driver for display.
 .
 To use this server, you must have a kernel that supports the framebuffer
 console device.  For the Alpha and i386 architectures, this capability is
 absent from the 2.0 (and earlier) kernel series.  Users of these
 architectures must use version 2.2 or later of the Linux kernel with support
 for an appropriate framebuffer console driver to employ this X server.

 X-TrueType extension.
Package: xfs-xtt
Description: X-TrueType font server
 This package provide X-TrueType font server. This is compatible  normal X
 font server, but added X-TrueType font handling scheme support instead of
 FreeType backend. XFree86 4.0's font server can handle TrueType too, but it
 can not handle TTCap. By using TTCap description, support for font
 transformations, such as slanting, adjusting glyph width, pseudo-bolding, etc.
 .
 xfs-xtt is a daemon that listens on a network port and serves X fonts to X servers
 (and thus to X clients).  All X servers have the ability to serve locally
 installed fonts for themselves, but xfs makes it possible to offload that job
 from the X server, and/or have a central repository of fonts on a networked
 machine running xfs so that all the machines running X servers on a network do
 not require their own set of fonts.  xfs may also be invoked by users to, for
 instance, make available X fonts in user accounts that are not available to
 the X server or to an already running system xfs-xtt.



Source package: xfsdump
Package: xfsdump
Description: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.



Source package: xfsprogs
Package: xfslibs-dev
Description: XFS filesystem-specific static libraries and headers.
 xfslibs-dev contains the libraries and header files needed to

 on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
 support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
 variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
 Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
 and scalability.
 .
 Refer to the documentation at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/
 for complete details.  This implementation is on-disk compatible
 with the IRIX version of XFS.
Package: xfsprogs-bf

 http://xine.sf.net/.
 .
 This package contains an additional front end, aaxine, which runs even on the
 console. aaxine uses aalib to render ASCII art video, or you can tell it to
 use a framebuffer device. This is more a proof of concept, but you can use it
 to watch DVDs on your old vt100 terminal, of course. ;-)
 .
 Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content Scrambling
 System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to descramble those DVDs,
 because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at
 /usr/share/doc/xine-ui/README.Debian for more information!

 .
 More precisely, grok is a program for displaying and editing strings
 arranged in a grid of rows and columns. Each row is presented as a "card"
 consisting of multiple columns, or "fields", that allow data entry. The
 presentation of the data is programmable; a user interface builder that
 allows the user to arrange fields on a card graphically is part of grok.
 Grok also supports a simple language that allows sophisticated queries
 and data retrieval. Grok comes with the above examples and a few others
 as pre-built applications.
 .
 Grok is not a general-purpose database program. It was designed for small
 applications typical for desktop accessories. If you attempt to run your

Source package: xsu
Package: xsu
Description: Allow users to run commands as root, after prompting for password.
 xsu is an interface for the command `su - username -c command` in Gnome. When
 the user executes xsu, he/she will be prompted for a command, a username and a
 password. If the username and password are correct xsu will execute the
 command as the entered user. So if the username was root, then the command
 will be executed as root.
 .
 Of course it's also possible to predefine the username and the command by
 using the [-u,--username] and [-c,--command] arguments at the command line of
 xsu. This can be very useful when using xsu in for example gmenu or the
 GNOME panel.
 .
 * Security
 Gnome Xsu 2.0 uses the standard su binary to gain it's root access. This way,
 all security issues should be solved.
 .
 The security of all older xsu versions was very bad. With xsu version 0.1.0
 the use of a pipe to a secured non-Gnome SUID application was introduced.
 This has been replaced with a special type of pipe to the standard GNU su
 application from the 'login' package.

Description: provides tide and current predictions
 XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide
 variety of formats. Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be generated,
 or a tide clock can be provided on your desktop.
 .
 XTide can work with the X window system, plain text terminals, or the
 web. This is accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive
 interface (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface (tide),
 and the web interface (xttpd).
 .
 The algorithm that XTide uses to predict tides is the one used by the
 National Ocean Service in the U.S. It is significantly more accurate than
 the simple tide clocks that can be bought in novelty stores. However, it
 takes more to predict tides accurately than just a spiffy algorithm -- you
 also need data for every location for which you want to predict tides.
 This package provide a sample data set for only one location so you can
 try out the package, but anything useful requires the data packaged in the
 xtide-data package (or downloaded from the XTide ftp site).

Source package: xvt
Package: xvt
Description: X terminal-emulator similar to xterm, but smaller
 xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less
 compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly
 intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but
 may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory.
 The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use
 of the X toolkit.
 .
 If you are looking for a more featureful terminal-emulator than xvt,
 but one which still uses less swap space than xterm, consider rxvt.
 .
 Features of xterm which xvt does not support include:
 .
  - Tektronix 4014 emulation
  - Session logging
  - Pop-up menus.  The only one of xterm's popup menu commands that
    is provided in xvt is displaying and hiding of the scrollbar
    and this is done simply by pressing any mouse key in the window
    with the CONTROL key held down.
  - Toolkit style configurability.  In particular, xvt does not
    allow the user to remap the mouse or keyboard keys.
 .
 Features which are supported include:
 .
  - VT100 emulation.  Most of the main escape sequences are supported --
    certainly all those used by the standard screen based UNIX
    applications.
  - Lines that scroll off the top of the window are saved and can be
    scrolled back with a scrollbar.
  - Text selection and insertion including double and triple click for
    words and lines.

Source package: xwit
Package: xwit
Description: a collection of simple routines to call some X11 functions
 xwit is a collection of simple routines to call some X11 functions
 that don't already have any utility commands built around them.
 The reasoning behind this is that loosely every X function should be
 accessible from a shell script.
 .
 For example, XWarpPointer() will move the X pointer, but no utility
 program exists to do so on those rare occasions when you could really
 use it.  xwit will also resize, iconify, pop, and move windows given
 by name or id, change an icon, title or name, set the screen saver
 going, and change individual key autorepeat settings, etc.



Source package: xwpe
Package: xwpe

Source package: xzgv
Package: xzgv
Description: Picture viewer for X with a thumbnail-based selector
 xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector.
 It uses GTK+ and Imlib. Most file formats are supported, and the
 thumbnails used are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. It can also
 be used with `xzgv file(s)', to effectively bypass the file selector.
 For more on how xzgv works and how to use it, do `info xzgv' or `man
 xzgv' once it's installed.
 .
 xzgv differs from other picture viewers for X in that it uses one
 window for both the file selector and viewer, it (unlike xv) allows
 both scrolling and fit-to-window methods of viewing large pictures,
 and it (unlike xv and some others) doesn't ever mangle the picture's
 aspect ratio.
 .
 It also provides extensive keyboard support; if you prefer using the
 keyboard, this is almost certainly the best viewer for you. But it
 doesn't skimp on the mousey stuff, either.
 .
 Note that this program is written by the author of the svgalib-based
 "zgv", and has similar features.

 yForth? is an interestingly small implementation of Forth for Linux.  It
 suffers several deficiencies.  For general Forth programming or learning

 .
 From the author's README:
 .
 yForth? is a Forth environment written entirely in ANSI C, making it
 extremely portable. The first thing I want to tell you about yForth? is
 that it seems a joke compared to other systems such as gForth or PFE.
 .
 Nevertheless, you could find yForth? nice, in which case you're invited to
 explore yForth?
 .
 It's yours, you can make anything you want with it. If you want an explanation
 of the words provided by yForth? please refer to the draft of ANS Forth or
 something equivalent.  The Net will help you.
 .
 Do not expect the prompt "ok" to come up when you run yForth?, the standard
 says that "ok" shall be printed AFTER every successful command execution...

Source package: yorick
Package: yorick
Description: interpreted language and scientific graphics
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * interactive scientific graphics
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers
 .
 The language features a compact syntax for many common array
 operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and
 efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
 variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
 similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be
 typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
 later use.
 .
 This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which
 you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs.

Source package: zope-emarket
Package: zope-emarket
Description: Simple e-commerce system for Zope
 Basically an EMarket is a folderish object that (currently) consists
 of a set of methods and five folderish 'Specialists'. Each specialist
 is responsible for managing one particular type of object. They have
 methods, and racks: methods to interface to the rest of the application,
 and racks to handle the storage and retrieval of the objects
 they manage:
 .
 marketItems: manage the market items in the EMarket
 .
 shoppers: manage the shopper objects
 .
 basketManager: manage the 'shopping baskets'
 .
 basketItemManager: manage the items in the shopping baskets.
 .
 transactions: manage the completed transactions
 .
 The idea here is to provide a framework for a 'shopping area' that is
 at once flexible, simple, and reasonably robust. The display of the
 market area is determined by editable templates that are contained in
 the marketItems folder. The display of the shopping 'Baskets' is
 managed by templates in the shoppers folder. This way each EMarket can
 be customized easily. Also, the developer picks the classes they
 want to use for shoppers, marketItems, etc... so they can also be used
 to customize the look and feel of the market.

Source package: zope-loginmanager
Package: zope-loginmanager
Description: User Folder workalike and replacement for Zope
 LoginManager is a User Folder workalike and replacement which solves the
 "N * M" problem seen with previous User Folders.  Because of its
 PlugIn-based architecture, it will almost never need to be subclassed to
 implement custom functionality. (For more information on the PlugIn
 system, see the Products.ZPatterns.PlugIns module source.)
 .
 LoginManager uses two kinds of PlugIns, the "User Source" and the "Login
 Method". User Sources provide an interface to an arbitrary store of user
 records. A LoginManager may contain multiple User Sources, and will
 search them in user-defined order until one returns a valid user object.
 .
 Login Methods are responsible for examining a REQUEST for identification
 and credentials. They are also indirectly responsible for authenticating
 the user. In most cases, they simply call user.authenticate(), passing
 the credentials (typically a password) they extracted from the REQUEST.
 A single LoginManager may contain multiple Login Methods, which are
 tried in user-defined order, and the result of the last Login Method is
 used. (Most Login Methods simply return the result of the previous Login
 Method if it had already validated a user. But the sequence is chained
 to allow for voting, multi-credential requirements, etc.)

Source package: zope-siteaccess
Package: zope-siteaccess
Description: Zope virtual hosting and folder access rules

 to publish the Zope object 'silly-walks/current' instead of just
 'current'.
 .
 SiteAccess provides the ability to force ZPublisher to call objects
 of your choice as it enters any folder. With this capability, you can
 designate a method in the Zope root to examine the request parameters
 and alter or replace the URL.

Source package: zope-zpatterns
Package: zope-zpatterns
Description: Database Independence and Framework Integration for Zope
 Provides a variety of base classes and frameworks for Zope product and
 application development.  Some currently available patterns include:
 .
 Plugins: A framework for Folder-like object ("plugin containers") to
 have management tabs ("plugin groups") that hold collections of objects
 ("plugins") supporting a particular collaboration interface ("plugin
 kind").
 .
 SheetProviders: A framework for providing database-independent property
 sheets to objects. SheetProviders are PlugIns which Racks and
 Specialists use to give their contents PropertySheets, without any
 objects (besides the SheetProviders) needing to know how the property
 sheets are implemented or where they are stored. One can create
 SheetProviders that store data in literally any kind of database
 accessible by Zope.
 .
 AttributeProviders: Similar to SheetProviders, but for individual object
 attributes.
 .
 Racks: A framework for database-independent collections of objects.
 Racks retrieve or store objects. They are SheetProviderContainers and
 AttributeProviderContainers, and thus allow for property sheets and
 attributes to be added to their contents from another database. The
 default Rack implementation stores all data in the ZODB (as do the
 default "provider" implementations), but the framework code is
 documented for easy subclassing to create alternative storage methods.
 .
 Specialists: A way of organizing your applications around object
 interfaces and class-level services. (Known as Implementors in the
 original RIPP Model).
