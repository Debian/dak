    #           the script. Can be the empty string, meaning true.
    #  - BG   - Background the function stage?
    #
    # ATTENTION: Spaces in arguments or timestamp names need to be escaped by \

    # NOTE 1: There are special values for the first column (FUNC).

    #                   the recording what already ran in an earlier cronscript.
