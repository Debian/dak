Dear PC World,

1) The most common chipset used in Pentium-II machines is the Intel 440BX. It is also relatively common in slower P-IIIs, and is approximately identical to the 440MX (a one-chip version aimed at laptops).

2) The 440BX has the interesting feature of only being able to address up to 128MBit density RAM. This is a relatively widely known issue.

3) Simple maths suggests that if you have a 128MB DIMM with 4 chips on it, they are likely to be 256MBit parts.

4) Marking said DIMMs as being suitable for Pentium-IIs is therefore really indescribably stupid, you wankwits. Please fuck off and die in a great big chemical fire before I get back there to beat you.

Love,

Matthew.

PS,

Die. No, really.

It's true that you learn something new every day. Yesterday I discovered that playdough is electrically conductive. I also discovered that RAM becomes unhappy if all of its pins are joined together with electrically conductive material.

This is based on an actual radio conversation between a U.S. Navy
aircraft carrier, U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, and Canadian authorities off
the coast of Newfoundland in October, 1995. The radio conversation was
released by the Chief of Naval Operations on 10/10/95 authorized by
the Freedom of Information Act.

Canadians: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the South to avoid
	   collision.

Americans: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the North to
	   avoid a collision.

Canadians: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to
	   the South to avoid a collision.

Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert
	   YOUR course.

Canadians: No, I say again, you divert YOUR course.

Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND
	   LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE
	   ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND
	   NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR
	   COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH--I SAY AGAIN, THAT'S ONE FIVE
	   DEGREES NORTH--OR COUNTER-MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO
	   ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.

Canadians: This is a lighthouse. Your call.
