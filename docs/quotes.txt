This is based on an actual radio conversation between a U.S. Navy
aircraft carrier, U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, and Canadian authorities off
the coast of Newfoundland in October, 1995. The radio conversation was
released by the Chief of Naval Operations on 10/10/95 authorized by
the Freedom of Information Act.

Canadians: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the South to avoid
	   collision.

Americans: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the North to
	   avoid a collision.

Canadians: Negative. You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to
	   the South to avoid a collision.

Americans: This is the Captain of a US Navy ship. I say again, divert
	   YOUR course.

Canadians: No, I say again, you divert YOUR course.

Americans: THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS LINCOLN, THE SECOND
	   LARGEST SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES' ATLANTIC FLEET. WE ARE
	   ACCOMPANIED BY THREE DESTROYERS, THREE CRUISERS AND
	   NUMEROUS SUPPORT VESSELS. I DEMAND THAT YOU CHANGE YOUR
	   COURSE 15 DEGREES NORTH--I SAY AGAIN, THAT'S ONE FIVE
	   DEGREES NORTH--OR COUNTER-MEASURES WILL BE UNDERTAKEN TO
	   ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THIS SHIP.

Canadians: This is a lighthouse. Your call.
